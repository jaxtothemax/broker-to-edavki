# TaxReporter — Claude Instructions

---

## Personas

TaxReporter turns exports from **foreign brokers** into XML that Slovenian tax residents
import into FURS eDavki: **Doh-KDVP** (gains on securities) and **Doh-Div** (dividends), every
amount converted at the **Banka Slovenije** rate. Foreign brokers do not report to FURS, so
the filer owns every number. Full personas: `.claude/personas.md`.

- **Maja** (Trading 212 saver, beginner): monthly fractional ETF buys, first-time filer, sold once in 2026. Values simplicity, privacy and plain-language reassurance. Pain: hundreds of slices, each needing its own BSI rate; paid services want her statement on their server.
- **Luka** (active IBKR investor + old Trading 212 account, advanced): ~300 trades/year in USD/GBP/CHF, splits, a spin-off, US dividends. Values correctness, determinism, provenance, CLI. Pain: no tool runs FIFO per ISIN across brokers; corporate actions and withholding reversals are guessed.
- **Nina** (tech employee with Schwab RSUs/ESPP, intermediate): sells vested lots. Values explanations of why each value was chosen. Pain: vest lots, sell-to-cover and acquisition codes are confusing and advice is contradictory.
- **Tadej** (open-source contributor, advanced): wants to add eToro/Revolut adapters in an evening. Values a small adapter interface, golden-file tests, fast CI. Pain: existing tools are single-broker, untested, or non-commercially licensed.
- **Mojca** (accountant filing for private clients, intermediate): a dozen clients each February. Values reproducibility, a printable audit report, data staying on the office PC. Pain: messy overlapping exports; uploading client data to third parties creates GDPR obligations.

## Tax correctness — always on

A wrong number here becomes a wrong tax return that a real person signs. These rules apply
to every change; the research behind them is in `docs/research/` (start with its README),
and a change to any of them needs a primary source (law text, FURS instructions or schema,
Banka Slovenije) cited in that directory **in the same PR**.

- **Exchange rates come from Banka Slovenije only.** BSI quotes units of foreign currency per
  1 EUR, so `EUR = amount / rate`. Use the list valid on the event date; for a weekend or TARGET
  holiday that is the last list published **before** it (fail loudly past a 10-day look-back).
  Currencies missing from the daily list use the BSI monthly list. Never use the broker's FX
  rate or an ECB rate silently, and keep the rate's provenance (source, list date, value) next
  to every converted amount so the UI and audit report can show it.
- **Dates:** acquisition and disposal use the trade (contract) date, never settlement; a
  dividend uses the date it was paid.
- **No binary floating point** for money, quantities or rates — use the project's decimal type,
  keep the original source strings, and round only when writing a form field, at that field's
  scale.
- **FIFO per security across every broker and account** of the taxpayer. Lots are matched by
  ISIN, never per file.
- **Never drop an input row silently.** Every row becomes a ledger event, an explicit
  "ignored (reason)" record, or a blocking diagnostic. An unsupported corporate action is
  refused with a diagnostic, never guessed.
- **FURS XML is generated in schema order and validated** against the vendored XSDs in
  `packages/furs/schemas/` in tests, plus the business rules the XSD does not encode (an
  8-digit tax number is required, a security list needs at least one purchase and one sale,
  empty typed elements are omitted, `F2` codes mean different things per list type). FURS
  edits its XSDs in place, so a schema change is a tax-rule change.
- **The tool prepares a return for the user to review; it never files.** Present computed tax
  as an estimate and show where every figure came from.

## Privacy — always on

- **Everything runs on the user's device.** There is no backend, no account, no telemetry.
- The only permitted network calls are fetching the project's own published rate snapshot
  (contains no user data) and the **opt-in** LLM check: bring-your-own key, explicit consent,
  and the exact redacted payload shown before anything is sent. Its findings are advisory and
  never change a computed value.
- Never log, cache outside a location the user chose, or put into error messages: tax numbers,
  names, addresses, account or order IDs, or raw broker rows.
- Real broker exports live only in `private/` (gitignored). Committed fixtures are synthetic or
  anonymized: scrub account, order and transaction IDs, names, and any amounts that could
  identify a person.

---

## Secure code — always on

Apply these to all new code and any existing code touched in a change. CI enforces a subset automatically — do not rely on it as the first line of defense.

**Untrusted input (every imported file is hostile):**
- **Bound everything** — file size, row count, decompressed size of XLSX/ZIP (zip bombs), and recursion depth
- **No code execution from data** — no `eval`, `new Function`, or dynamic `import()` of anything derived from a file
- **XML parsing never resolves DTDs or external entities** (XXE); reject a DOCTYPE in broker XML
- **Regexes run on file content must not backtrack catastrophically** (ReDoS); prefer anchored, linear patterns
- **Parsers do not touch the network**

**Generated output:**
- **XML is built through the writer's escaping API** — never string-concatenate unescaped text into XML
- **CSV/XLSX audit exports neutralize formula injection** — prefix cells starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, tab or CR

**Secrets:**
- **No hardcoded credentials** — the only secret is the user's own LLM API key, supplied at runtime (env var for the CLI, in-memory or explicitly opted-in local storage in the browser), never logged and never committed
- **Use `crypto.getRandomValues` / `crypto.randomUUID`**, not `Math.random`, for anything that must be unguessable

**Frontend:**
- **No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`** unless the content is sanitized and the reason is documented inline
- **Keep the static app under a strict Content Security Policy** — no inline scripts, no third-party origins except the opt-in LLM endpoint

## Branching model — GitHub Flow

This project follows GitHub Flow with tagged releases:

```
feature branch ──PR──► main ──tag vX.Y.Z──► GitHub Release
```

### Branches

| Branch | Purpose | Protected |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | Integration branch — latest accepted code; the docs site deploys from it | Yes — PRs only, required status checks, no direct push |
| `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `docs/*`, `chore/*` | Short-lived feature/fix branches | No |

### Workflow

**Feature development:**
1. `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
2. `git checkout -b <prefix>/<short-description>` (or `scripts/wt new <issue>` for a worktree)
3. Make changes, commit, push branch
4. Open a PR targeting `main` (`/mr`), wait for **green checks**, then a maintainer merges

**Releasing:**
1. `/release` prepares the release PR (version bump, changelog assembly, `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md`)
2. After it merges and the merged commit's checks on `main` are green, tag it:
   `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`
3. `.github/workflows/release.yml` re-checks that commit's status and publishes the GitHub Release
   from `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md`

**Hotfixes:** branch from `main`, PR, merge, tag a patch release. There is no `production`
branch; add one only if the project starts maintaining patch lines for older minors.

**Rules:**
- **Never commit directly to `main`** — all changes go through PRs
- **Never merge a PR with failing checks** — fix the root cause; never bypass CI

---

## General conventions

- Branch naming: `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `chore/`
- **Changelog entries use fragment files** — create `changelog.d/<slug>.<type>.md` instead of editing `CHANGELOG.md` directly. Valid types: `added`, `changed`, `fixed`, `security`. Fragments are assembled at release time.
- **Tests and docs go in the same commit as the code change** — never as a follow-up commit or separate PR. A code change without its test update is incomplete:
  - Tests: colocated `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` next to the source in `packages/*/src/` and `apps/*/src/`
  - Fixtures: `packages/<package>/test/fixtures/` — synthetic or anonymized only (see *Privacy*)
  - User documentation: `website/src/content/docs/`; contributor documentation: `docs/` (`adr/`, `research/`, `spec/`, `releases/`)
- **Grep before renaming any symbol, field, or env var** — run `grep -r 'old_name' .` across the full repo (including CI config, docs, and test files) before committing the rename. Missing a shadow copy in a test fixture or CI job env block is the most common failure class in batch commits.
- **Declare a load-bearing call site in `load-bearing.declarations`** — when a guard, hook, filter, or validator is wired in by exactly **one** line, and deleting that line leaves the whole suite green, add a stanza there. `scripts/check-load-bearing.sh` (pre-push + CI) then fails when that line disappears. This is the only failure class where nothing else in the harness goes red: the guard stops guarding, silently, and every test keeps passing. Do not declare ordinary code — the test for a declaration is to delete the line and run the suite, not to reason about it
- Use **US English** in code, comments and English docs — "color" not "colour", "canceled" not "cancelled". Slovenian is used verbatim for FURS/BSI terms and quotations (`Doh-KDVP`, *popisni list*, *tečajnica*)
- When writing complex business logic (lot matching, rate selection, rounding, form-field mapping), add a comment explaining **why** — the legal rule or constraint, with a pointer to the `docs/research/` section — not what

**Tech stack:** TypeScript (strict, ESM) on Node 24 LTS · pnpm workspaces (`packages/core`, `packages/fx`, `packages/furs`, `packages/brokers`, `packages/pipeline`, `apps/cli`, `apps/web`) · Vitest · ESLint + Prettier · React + Vite static web app and a Node CLI · Astro Starlight docs site (`website/`) on GitHub Pages · GitHub Actions. No backend, no database. Architecture: `docs/adr/`.

---

## Git workflow discipline

These rules prevent common workflow failures that waste CI cycles and cause merge conflicts:

- **Always use heredoc syntax for multi-line strings** — git commit messages, PR descriptions (`gh pr create --body`), and any shell command that takes a multi-line argument. Inline `\n` is not interpreted as a newline by the shell and renders as literal text. Correct pattern:
  ```bash
  gh pr create --base main --title "..." --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
  ## Summary
  - bullet one
  EOF
  )"
  ```
- **Never auto-merge PRs** — agents and skills must create the PR and stop. The user reviews and merges all PRs manually (`gh pr merge` is denied in `.claude/settings.json`)
- **Always branch from `main`** — never branch from another feature branch, even if your work depends on it. If you need changes from an unmerged branch, wait for it to land in `main` first
- **Fetch before comparing to remote** — when checking whether local and remote branches diverge, always `git fetch origin` first. Stale local refs cause false conclusions
- **Rebase sequence for batched PRs** — when merging a series of related PRs in order, after each PR lands: pull `main`, rebase the next branch onto `main`, run its tests, force-push, then hand back for merge
- **Pre-release is a one-time gate, not a fix loop** — `/pre-release full` runs all agents once to produce a report. Fix issues in separate commits, then re-run only if a full re-audit is warranted. Do not run `/pre-release full` iteratively to verify each fix
- **Parallel/multi-issue work uses `scripts/wt`** — for concurrent issues or parallel agent sessions, create an isolated git worktree with `scripts/wt new <issue>`. It branches off the latest `origin/main` into a sibling `../<repo>-wt/` dir and auto-detects and symlinks dev-dep dirs (`node_modules` etc.) back to the main checkout. WIP cap is 10 (warns at 8; raise it per invocation with `WT_CAP` for a deliberate burst). `wt new` / `wt claim` **check the issue out** — a `status:wip` label plus a check-out comment posted with `gh issue comment` (`WT_LOCK_LABEL` to rename) — and refuse an issue already checked out unless `--force`; `wt prune`, `wt remove` (once the issue is closed) and `wt release <issue>` clear it, and `/batch` skips labeled issues. **Nothing reaps a worktree after a PR merge**: from the main checkout, `scripts/wt prune` removes every worktree whose branch merged and was deleted on origin — whether it landed as a merge commit, a rebased or amended tip, or a squash — and `scripts/wt remove <issue>` removes one. This prevents one session's `git checkout` from swapping the working tree under another. Run `scripts/wt help` for all subcommands.

## Milestone commitment — every issue in a dated milestone carries one `release:*` label

A milestone with a date is a promise, and a few hundred issues against one date
is not a plan. State the shape of that promise with exactly one of these labels per
issue. GitHub labels are **not** mutually exclusive (there are no scoped labels), so
exclusivity is ours to keep: whenever you apply one, remove the other two in the same
call — `gh issue edit <N> --add-label release:committed --remove-label release:reserve,release:stretch`.
`/tracker-hygiene` reports issues that carry more than one.

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `release:committed` | Ships, or the release slips. The **only** issues that appear as bullets in a public roadmap's section for that milestone. |
| `release:reserve` | A slot held against inbound work from real users. Spent when someone real hits something. The reserve is a number written on the milestone, not a sentiment. |
| `release:stretch` | Stays in the milestone and ships if there is time. Moves to the next milestone at feature freeze without discussion. Never a roadmap bullet. |

- **When an issue moves into the current dated milestone — whether you file it
  there, re-milestone it, or a script places it — stop and ask the user which of
  the three applies. Never infer it.** The commitment state is the user's call
  every time: a guessed `release:committed` is a promise nobody made, and a
  guessed `release:stretch` quietly drops work the user meant to ship. If the
  user's own instruction already names the label, apply it without asking. If the
  user does not answer, **leave the issue unlabeled and say so** — an unlabeled
  issue in a dated milestone is a visible gap, a guessed label is an invisible one.
- Changing an issue's commitment means applying the new value and removing the old
  one in the same edit. Do not stack them.
- Whatever label the project uses for intended-but-unmilestoned work is not a
  fourth value on this axis. Reason tags (`0.X-hardening` and the like) coexist
  with any of the three.
- A bucket rule is fine for the **first** pass over an existing milestone
  (charter work → committed, other bugs → reserve, polish and unclaimed features
  → stretch). It is not a substitute for asking on each subsequent move.

---

## Testing conventions

- **Run scoped tests before committing** — run the affected test file(s) locally before every `git commit` (`pnpm vitest run <path>`). Run `make typecheck` after any TypeScript change — it catches fixture and interface drift that behavioral tests miss. Do not treat CI as the first line of defense.
- **Golden files for anything FURS ingests** — every form builder change is covered by an expected-XML golden test that is also validated against the vendored XSD. Update a golden file only together with the reason (the rule or source that changed) in the same commit.
- **One fixture per known broker export revision** — broker formats drift; an adapter change adds a fixture for the new header set and keeps the old ones passing.
- **Known-answer tests for rates and rounding** — e.g. NOK on 2025-10-23 is 11.8529 (BSI, differs from today's ECB value), a Saturday resolves to Friday's list, TWD uses the monthly list (see `docs/research/03-bsi-exchange-rates.md`).
- **Grep for changed string literals** across all test files when renaming UI copy: `grep -r 'old text' packages apps`
- **Stale mocks fail silently** — if a module's exported API changes (new function, renamed arg), every test file mocking that module must be updated in the same commit

---

## Documentation conventions

- Docs live in the repo alongside the code — never in a separate repo
- When writing or updating documentation, invoke `/docs`
- Docs root: `website/src/content/docs/` (user docs; the roadmap page `website/src/content/docs/roadmap.md` is the single source of truth below) and `docs/` (ADRs, research, specs, release notes)

### Version-status tense — past-tense claims reference shipped versions only

A phrase anchoring behavior to a version — "shipped in X.Y", "added in X.Y", "X.Y
introduced Z" — may use past or present tense **only if X.Y is at or below the latest
shipped release**. For unshipped versions use future tense: "ships in X.Y", "planned for
X.Y", "coming in X.Y".

- **Single source of truth:** the roadmap page. Every other doc derives its tense from
  what that page says is Shipped / Underway / Planned.
- **Exception:** ADRs are design-decision artifacts — "X.Y will ship Z" is correct there.
- **Before publishing:** grep the docs tree for the version string and verify every
  occurrence matches the roadmap's classification.

This prevents the failure where a banner and a feature page drift into past tense for a
version that has not tagged, because nothing bound them to a single source. A wrong tense
on a version claim is a user-facing accuracy bug, not a style preference — there is no
fast-path exemption.

Version callouts in user docs:
- New features: add `> **Added in X.Y**` immediately after the section heading
- Changed/fixed behavior: no callout
- Patch releases: no callout — only minor releases and pre-releases get callouts

## CLAUDE.md and auto memory — two complementary systems

Claude Code uses two persistence mechanisms that serve different purposes:

| | `CLAUDE.md` | Auto memory (`~/.claude/projects/…/memory/`) |
|---|---|---|
| **Written by** | You (intentionally) | Claude (automatically, from corrections and confirmations) |
| **Scope** | Everyone on the project | Your machine only |
| **What goes here** | Conventions, rules, architecture decisions, agent workflow | User-specific preferences, corrections Claude should remember, session learnings |
| **Committed to git** | Yes | No |

**Rules:**
- Keep `CLAUDE.md` focused on *durable project rules* — things that apply to everyone
- Let auto memory accumulate *individual learnings* — Claude will write these itself when it observes corrections or confirmations
- Review auto memory periodically with `/memory` to prune stale entries
- Never duplicate content between `CLAUDE.md` and auto memory; if a rule belongs to everyone, it belongs in `CLAUDE.md`

**`@path` imports** — `CLAUDE.md` can embed the content of any other file using `@path/to/file` on its own line. Use this to keep the root `CLAUDE.md` concise while storing detailed reference material in separate files:

```markdown
<!-- In CLAUDE.md -->
See @docs/api-conventions.md for REST API rules.
See @frontend/CLAUDE.md for design system conventions.
```

**Nested `CLAUDE.md` files** are the real path-scoping mechanism — Claude Code has no
`paths:`-glob loader; a directory of standalone rule files with frontmatter like that is
a convention from a different tool and is never read. What actually loads automatically,
besides the root file, is a `CLAUDE.md` placed **inside the directory it governs**: it is
pulled in whenever Claude reads or edits a file under that directory, keeping
stack-specific rules out of the root file without adding a second loader to learn.

```
scripts/CLAUDE.md    <- loads when editing anything under scripts/
frontend/CLAUDE.md   <- loads when editing anything under frontend/
```

This repository uses the pattern in two places: **`scripts/CLAUDE.md`**, the rules for
its own CI gate scripts (`ci/CLAUDE.md` is a one-line `@` import of it, so `ci/**` picks up
the same rules without duplicating them), and **`apps/web/CLAUDE.md`**, the web app's
design system.

A glob that does not map to one real directory — "every `*.test.*` file, wherever it
lives" — cannot be expressed this way; put that content in the nearest directory that
actually contains those files, or fall back to an `@path` import from the root file if
the content is short enough to always load.

**A rules file that every branch appends to must become an index.** A path-scoped
`CLAUDE.md` that collects one numbered rule per UI or API branch grows without bound and
is loaded whole on every matching session. Upstream, `packages/web/CLAUDE.md` reached
457 KB and was edited by 112 of 545 merges in 30 days. It also becomes the batch's
guaranteed merge conflict. Once that happens, restructure it:

- Keep **one index line per rule** in the `CLAUDE.md` — the rule's number and its bold
  headline, plus the operative clause where the headline is only a label — linking to
  its full text in a separate file (`docs/design/invariants/<N>-<slug>.md`). Upstream,
  the index dropped from 457 KB to 56 KB with every rule number unchanged.
- Mark the index `merge=union` in `.gitattributes`, so concurrent additions stop
  conflicting.
- Union merge hides three defects that now exist **only on the merged tree**: a
  duplicate number, a line doubled because two branches edited the same rule, and an
  index line whose body file did not come with it. Gate all three, and run that gate in
  `/mass-merge` Phase A.

The same reasoning applies to any registration point every feature touches: register
one entry per line, as `make pre-push-checks` does.

## Claude Code settings reference

`.claude/settings.json` controls Claude Code behaviour at the project level. All keys shown below are optional — omit any you want to leave at the default. The template ships with safe defaults pre-configured.

```jsonc
{
  // Context loading
  // Glob patterns to exclude from auto-loaded CLAUDE.md context.
  // Use for generated files, vendored code, or large directories
  // you never want Claude to read automatically.
  "claudeMdExcludes": [],           // e.g. ["vendor/**", "*.generated.*", "dist/**"]

  // Effort and reasoning
  // Token budget for reasoning steps. "low" = faster and cheaper;
  // "high" = deeper analysis for complex tasks; "normal" suits most work.
  "effortLevel": "normal",          // "low" | "normal" | "high"
  // Force extended thinking on every response. Leave false unless the
  // project work is consistently complex enough to justify the cost.
  "alwaysThinkingEnabled": false,

  // Shell
  // Which shell tool Claude uses. Only "bash" or "powershell" are valid —
  // not a path, and not zsh/fish. Omit to keep the default.
  "defaultShell": "bash",           // "bash" | "powershell"

  // Sandboxing
  // Run Bash commands inside a sandbox (macOS Seatbelt / Linux seccomp).
  // Prevents writes outside the project dir and network access.
  // Enable for security-sensitive projects; disable if your build
  // commands need broader access. Must be an object, not a boolean.
  "sandbox": { "enabled": false },

  // Permissions
  // Allow / deny / ask rules for tool calls. The template ships with safe
  // defaults: read-only tracker + git queries are allowed; force-push,
  // auto-merge, and reading secrets (.env, *.pem) are denied. Rules match
  // "Tool(pattern)" — a trailing wildcard prefix-matches, written either as
  // a space before the star ("Bash(git push --force *)") or a colon
  // ("Bash(git push --force:*)"); both forms are equivalent. No wildcard
  // means an exact-command match.
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [],                  // e.g. ["Bash(make test)", "Bash(gh pr list *)"]
    "ask": [],                    // prompt before running — e.g. ["Bash(git push *)"]
    "deny": []                    // never allowed — e.g. ["Read(./.env)", "Bash(gh pr merge *)"]
  },

  // Hook security
  // HTTP URLs that Claude Code is permitted to POST to when a hook
  // uses "type": "http". Any URL not in this list is blocked.
  "allowedHttpHookUrls": [],        // e.g. ["https://hooks.example.com/claude"]

  // Plugins — both are objects (records), not arrays
  "enabledPlugins": {},             // e.g. { "my-plugin@my-marketplace": true }
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {}      // e.g. { "my-marketplace": { "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "org/repo" } } }
}
```

The shipped `.claude/settings.json` omits `defaultShell`, `sandbox`, `enabledPlugins`
and `extraKnownMarketplaces` entirely — the defaults are what the template wants, and an
empty `[]` or bare `false` in those slots fails schema validation and is ignored with a
warning.

### Hook types

Hooks support two delivery mechanisms:

**`"type": "command"`** — runs a local shell script. The tool event JSON is available on stdin and as `$CLAUDE_TOOL_INPUT`.

**`"type": "http"`** — POSTs the event JSON to a webhook URL. The URL must be listed in `allowedHttpHookUrls`.

```json
{
  "PostToolUse": [
    {
      "matcher": "Edit|Write",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "http",
          "url": "https://hooks.example.com/claude",
          "timeout": 5
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Hook output contract — differs by event; verify it, don't guess it

A `command` hook talks back to Claude two ways: its exit code, and (on exit 0, or exit 2
for a block) a JSON object on stdout under `hookSpecificOutput`. **The available fields
differ per event, and guessing one event's shape for another is the most common way a
hook silently does nothing.** `UserPromptSubmit` and `PreToolUse` look similar but are not
interchangeable:

- **`UserPromptSubmit`** can inject non-blocking text into Claude's context via
  `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` — a "here is what you'll need" heads-up that
  never stops the prompt from being processed.
- **`PreToolUse`** has no `additionalContext` field — that channel does not exist at this
  event. The only way a `PreToolUse` hook hands Claude a message is
  `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision` (`"allow"` / `"deny"` / `"ask"`, plus `"defer"`
  in non-interactive `-p` mode only) with a `permissionDecisionReason` string, which is
  used **only when the decision is `"deny"`** — a denied call is cancelled and the reason
  is fed back to Claude so it can adjust and retry. Exit code 2 blocks the same way,
  reading the reason from `permissionDecisionReason` if valid JSON was written, or from
  stderr otherwise (see `.claude/hooks/pre-tool-safety.sh` for the exit-code form, and
  `.claude/hooks/pre-mr-security-gate.sh` for the JSON `permissionDecision: "deny"` form).

Before writing a hook's output block, check the current contract for that specific event
at the official Claude Code hooks reference rather than porting a shape from a hook on a
different event — this project's own `pre-mr-security-gate.sh` was rewired from
`UserPromptSubmit` to `PreToolUse` in #11 specifically because the two events' output
contracts are not interchangeable.

### Hook `if` field

Every hook entry accepts an optional `"if"` shell expression. The hook runs only when the expression exits 0. Use this to filter on specific tool inputs without writing a full shell script:

```json
{
  "PreToolUse": [
    {
      "matcher": "Bash",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/pre-push-guard.sh\"",
          "if": "echo \"$CLAUDE_TOOL_INPUT\" | python3 -c \"import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); exit(0 if 'git push' in d.get('command','') else 1)\"",
          "timeout": 5
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Why no hook caps subagent fan-out (issue #54)

`settings.json`'s `deny` list guards the *outputs* of agent work (force-push, auto-merge,
reading secrets). It has no lever for the *shape* of the work itself — how many agents
one task spawns, or whether a delegated agent re-delegates. A `PreToolUse`/`SubagentStart`
hook that counts or blocks fan-out was considered and rejected, not skipped:

- **`SubagentStart`/`SubagentStop` cannot block.** They are metadata lifecycle events,
  not tool calls, and are not in the set of events exit-code-2 blocking applies to — so
  there is no hook point that can refuse a subagent spawn the way `pre-mr-security-gate.sh`
  refuses a `Bash` call.
- **Matching the spawn itself on `PreToolUse` is version-fragile.** Community reports
  describe a `matcher: "Task"` rule intercepting subagent spawns on some Claude Code
  versions, but the tool's name is undocumented and has changed across releases (`Task`
  vs. `Agent`) — a hook keyed to the wrong name fails **silently**, which is worse than no
  hook.
- **Whether hooks fire for tool calls made *by* a subagent is itself disputed.** The hooks
  reference states subagent tool calls carry `agent_id`/`agent_type` through the same
  configured hooks; a still-open upstream report says the opposite — that only the main
  thread's own tool calls fire them. Building a fan-out cap on a contract that isn't
  settled is exactly the "fabricate an enforcement that quietly does nothing" trap this
  section exists to avoid.

**What is enforceable today lives at the agent-definition layer, not `settings.json`:**
an agent whose `.claude/agents/<name>.md` frontmatter omits `Agent` from `tools:` cannot
spawn sub-agents at all — that's a real, load-bearing restriction, not prose (see
`accessibility`, `ux-review`, `completeness-check`, `generated-artifact-check`, all
deliberately tools-restricted this way).
The fan-out *ceiling* — wave size, no re-delegation, model choice — is enforced by
review discipline instead: see *Subagent fan-out ceiling* under *Agent workflow* below,
and verify what a delegated agent actually did (`git log`, the MR it opened) rather than
trusting its summary.

## Fast paths by change class — read this first

The agent workflow below describes the full chain for the heaviest case: a new
user-visible feature that touches API, UI, and data model at once. **Most changes
are smaller.** Apply this table *first*. If a change clearly fits one row, run only
the gates in that row — the unnamed gates are out of scope. Do not run the full
chain out of habit; proportional ceremony is the point.

| Change class | Required gates (in order) |
|---|---|
| Pure bugfix with identified root cause | `regression-check` → `test-scaffold` (if no coverage) → `completeness-check` → `changelog` → `/mr` |
| Dependency bump (single package, no API change) | `dependency` → `changelog` → `/mr` |
| Docs-only | `docs` (if a new page) → `completeness-check` → `/mr` |
| Chore / CI config / lint-only | `/mr` |
| Core-logic-only change (parser, calculation, or output generation; no UI change) | `architect` → pre-MR gate batch → `test-scaffold` → `completeness-check` → `changelog` → `/mr` |
| Wiring onto an already-designed surface (a form or toggle bound to *existing* core logic, inside a shell whose design already shipped, no new interaction pattern) | `ux-review` (visual diff) → `security-review` + `regression-check` → `test-scaffold` → `completeness-check` → `changelog` → `/mr` |
| Frontend-only feature (no API change) | `architect` → `ux-design` → implement → `ux-review` + `accessibility` → `test-scaffold` → `completeness-check` → `changelog` → `/mr` |
| New user-visible feature (full stack) | `/voc` → `architect` → `ux-design` → implement → pre-MR gate batch → `ux-review` + `accessibility` → `test-scaffold` → `completeness-check` → `changelog` → `/mr` |
| Broker adapter (new broker, or a new export revision of a supported one) | implement with anonymized fixtures for every known header revision → `security-review` + `regression-check` → `test-scaffold` (if uncovered) → `completeness-check` → `changelog` → `/mr` |
| Tax-rule, exchange-rate-rule or FURS-schema change | primary source cited in `docs/research/` → `architect` → implement + golden-file updates → `regression-check` → `completeness-check` → `changelog` (`changed`, naming affected returns) → `/mr` |
| New trust-boundary subsystem (file import/parsing of untrusted input, generated output another system ingests, external input) | `threat-model` → `architect` → implement → pre-MR gate batch (incl. `security-review`) → `test-scaffold` → `completeness-check` → `changelog` → `/mr` |

When a change spans rows, take the **union**. When a change is genuinely ambiguous,
default to the **heavier** row — but say which row you chose and why, so the user
can redirect. When a whole class of change keeps triggering a gate that finds
nothing, that is a signal to add a carve-out row here — see `/kaizen`.

## Pre-MR gate batch — run in parallel, not serially

The pre-MR gate pair — `regression-check` and `security-review` — are
**independent reads of the same diff**. Neither depends on the other's
output. Run them as a **single parallel agent batch** (multiple Agent calls in one
message), then consolidate the findings before `/mr`. Serial invocation of these is
the single biggest avoidable source of pre-MR drag.

Apply only the gates relevant to the diff:
- `security-review` — only if file import/parsing, input handling, output generation, or a dependency's trust surface changed
- `regression-check` — **always**, on any source-touching branch

**Then, before `git push`, run `completeness-check`** (`.claude/agents/completeness-check.md`)
— one fresh agent that did not write the branch, reading the issue (with comments), the
diff and the code. It is serial *after* the batch on purpose: it audits the branch the
batch's fixes produced. It exists because an upstream audit found gaps in 16 of 20 merged
MRs whose rules were already written down but that nobody but the author had applied
before the push. Fix every finding in a **new commit, never an amend**,
so the fix diff stays separable. Then at most **one** more pass, never a loop: a full
**round 2** (fresh Opus, not shown round 1's findings) when round 1 reported a
`class-missed` or `collateral` BLOCKER or four or more findings; otherwise a narrow
**fix-diff re-check** of the fix commits only, when round 1 returned a BLOCKER or a fix
commit changes executable behavior (application code, CI logic, a gate or check
script — not docs, tests, comments, or changelog text). Record the re-check as
`gate: completeness-check/fix-diff — <N> findings` (`/fix-diff`, not parentheses: the
ledger parser drops a label with a space or paren), `n/a` when the fix round was docs,
tests, comments, or changelog only; record round 2 as a second `completeness-check` line with
`round 2` first in its parenthetical. See `.claude/agents/completeness-check.md`
§ After round 1. Its `## Requirements`
table goes in the PR description, and the `pr-followups` CI job fails any PR description
that names a follow-up without an open issue.

Any 🔴 Critical/High finding stops the MR: surface it and ask the user how to
proceed. 🟡/🟢 findings are summarized inline, then `/mr` continues.

## Agent workflow

The following agents are available and should be used proactively. Model assignments ensure the right reasoning level for each task: **opus** for synthesis, trade-off analysis, and judgment calls; **sonnet** for pattern scanning, checklist execution, and code generation.

### Subagent fan-out ceiling — a default, not a suggestion

Everything above guards the *outputs* of agent work. This is the guard on its *shape*.
Upstream, a wave of delegated agents cost ~122M tokens per merged MR — 95.9% cache reads,
3.9% cache creation, 0.2% output, so the bill is `turn count × context size × fan-out`,
not generation. Spend was concentrated, not uniform: the top 10 of 169 subagents were 44%
of the total, one at 166M against a 6M median. A single wandering agent costs more than
twenty focused ones. Defaults, for **any** multi-agent orchestration in this project —
not only `/batch`:

- **Cap concurrent delegated agents at 5 per task** (`/batch`'s default wave size).
  Past that, stop and ask, and say why the task needs more before spawning.
- **A delegated agent does not re-delegate.** One level of Phase-1 research delegation is
  fine for the opus agents that declare it in `.claude/agents/*.md` (`architect`,
  `dependency`, `docs`, `regression-check`, `security-review`, `test-scaffold`,
  `threat-model`, `ux-design`, `voc` — see *Agent file frontmatter reference* below); the
  sonnet sub-agents *they* launch must not themselves list `Agent` in `tools:`, so nesting
  never goes past one level (upstream: unbounded nesting produced a 2 → 16 fan-out on a
  task that needed neither).
- **Read-only gates run on Sonnet under `/batch`**. `/batch` passes `model: "sonnet"` when it spawns
  them, which overrides the `model: opus` frontmatter that `regression-check` and
  `security-review` carry for standalone use. They escalate to Opus only on `/batch`'s named
  criteria (root cause unknown, fix spans ≥3 packages, changes core domain semantics, or
  needs a design judgment the issue doesn't settle) — "this is important" and "this is a
  security fix" are not escalation criteria on their own.
- **Explicit override**: a deliberately large wave is `/batch`'s job — raise `WT_CAP` and
  state the new size and the reason in the report, rather than quietly spawning past the
  default.

This is prose discipline, enforced by review rather than a setting — see *Why no hook
caps subagent fan-out* above for why `settings.json` cannot enforce it directly today, and
*Step 6 — Verify before you believe it* in `.claude/skills/batch/SKILL.md` for how to
check what a delegated agent actually did instead of trusting its summary.

### Planning gate (once, before development on a new release)

- **`/dotplanning [version]`** — the begin-gate bookend to `/pre-release`. Run **once**
  at the kickoff of a new release milestone, before any feature branch exists: it
  resolves the milestone scope, builds a feature→asset map, flags every missing
  screen/flow/endpoint/model/doc, surfaces the decisions that must be answered before
  coding, sequences the work into gated workstreams, and drops a self-contained HTML
  report. Development then follows the plan, one workstream at a time, through the
  fast-paths chain below. Do not re-run per feature.

### Feature design sequence (mandatory for new features and UX changes)

For any new user-facing feature or UX change, follow this sequence in order:

1. **`voc`** (opus) — Voice of the Customer panel. Run first to surface adoption blockers and persona tensions before any technical design.
2. **`threat-model`** (opus) — *only if the feature crosses a trust boundary* (auth, uploads, tenancy, external input). Reasons about data flow and trust boundaries before code exists; feeds the architect's ADR.
3. **`architect`** (opus) — Technical architecture review. Include the VoC panel summary (and threat model, if run) so design decisions are informed by user priorities and security constraints.
4. **`ux-design`** (opus) — UI/UX design proposal. Include the architect review so the design aligns with the approved technical approach.
5. Implement the feature.
6. **`ux-review`** (sonnet) + **`accessibility`** (sonnet) — design-system compliance and WCAG 2.1 AA conformance, after implementation.

Do not skip the VoC step for user-facing work. If a feature has no UI component, skip steps 4 and 6 but still run VoC and architect.

### During implementation
- **`test-scaffold`** (sonnet) — when test coverage doesn't exist for affected code
- **`security-review`** (opus) — when modifying file import/parsing, input handling, or generated output
- **`dependency`** (sonnet) — before adding any new package

### Before creating an issue
- Search the tracker for duplicates and partial overlaps in open and recently closed issues (`gh issue list --state all --search "<key terms>"`) before filing a new one; `/tracker-hygiene` sweeps for them after the fact

### Before merging
- Run the **pre-MR gate batch** (`regression-check`, `security-review`) as one parallel agent batch — see the *Pre-MR gate batch* section above. Apply only the gates relevant to the diff.
- **`completeness-check`** (sonnet; opus when `batch`'s escalation criteria apply) — after the gate batch, before `git push`: a fresh agent audits the branch against its issue
- **`changelog`** (sonnet) — creates fragment file for the CI changelog-check job
- **`docs`** (sonnet) — when writing or updating documentation

### Harness self-improvement
- **`/kaizen`** — periodically audit the *development process itself* (CI, gate chain, pre-push, MR flow) for friction and propose a small, ranked list of speed wins. Distinct from `/pre-release` (which audits the code): kaizen audits the harness. When a gate keeps firing on a change class and finding nothing, kaizen is where that carve-out gets proposed for the fast-paths table.

### Pre-release gate

Run `/pre-release full` at feature freeze and again before cutting a release tag. This is a **one-time gate check**, not an iterative fix-verify loop:

1. Run `/pre-release full` → produces a report with 🔴 🟡 🟢 findings
2. Fix all 🔴 blockers in separate commits
3. Triage 🟡 findings: fix now or create milestone issues
4. Only re-run `/pre-release full` if the fixes were substantial enough to warrant a full re-audit
5. Proceed to `/release` once blockers are resolved

### Skills (user-invocable)
- **`/kickoff`** — interactive project setup from this template (name, personas, first milestone) ⛔
- **`/import-spec`** — convert a PRD/spec/feature list into structured tracker issues ⛔
- **`/import-design`** — convert a design guide into `frontend/CLAUDE.md` for the UX agents
- **`/dotplanning`** — plan a release milestone before development starts (feature→asset map, gaps, sequenced plan, HTML report) ⛔
- **`/mr`** — open a pull request (includes pre-flight checks and test verification; the name is kept from upstream Blueprint) ⛔
- **`/fix-mr`** — get a blocked PR to green AND mergeable: failing checks and conflicts with the default branch (up to 3 iterations) ⛔
- **`/mass-merge`** — land a batch of already-green PRs without reddening the default branch ⛔
- **`/batch`** — land a wave of milestone issues in parallel, one worktree and one delegated agent per issue ⛔
- **`/review`** — code review against project conventions for a file or branch diff
- **`/adr`** — create an Architecture Decision Record with sequential numbering
- **`/ci-debug`** — diagnose a failing GitHub Actions run
- **`/kaizen`** — audit the development harness for friction and propose ranked speed wins
- **`/incident-postmortem`** — postmortem one resolved harness/process incident; writes the lesson to the memory store
- **`/tracker-hygiene`** — sweep the tracker for label, duplicate, and staleness drift between kickoffs
- **`/release`** — create a release (version suggestion, pre-flight, changelog rotation) ⛔
- **`/pre-release`** — cross-cutting audit (security, regression, docs) before a release
- **`/voc`** — Voice of the Customer panel (also available as an agent for proactive invocation)
- **`/voc-audit`** — VoC panel against a shipped surface, findings verified against the code ⛔
- **`/sunset-check`** — decide whether an existing surface should be removed, fixed, narrowed, or demoted
- **`/memory-audit`** — sweep the Claude Code memory store for what makes it unrecallable ⛔

⛔ = `disable-model-invocation: true` — user-only, not auto-invoked by Claude

### Model assignment rationale

The `model:` in an agent's frontmatter is its default for standalone use. `/batch` overrides
it at spawn time by passing `model: "sonnet"` on the Agent call, so the opus row below does
not apply to `regression-check` and `security-review` inside a `/batch` wave.

| Model | Used for | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **opus** | architect, threat-model, security-review, ux-design, regression-check, voc | Cross-file reasoning, trade-off analysis, persona empathy, attack scenario modeling |
| **sonnet** | changelog, completeness-check (opus when `batch`'s escalation criteria apply), dependency, docs, generated-artifact-check, test-scaffold, ux-review, accessibility | Pattern matching, checklist execution, structured code generation |

Opus agents that delegate Phase 1 research use sonnet sub-agents for the mechanical scanning, then do the synthesis themselves. This balances cost and quality.

### Agent file frontmatter reference

Each file in `.claude/agents/` uses YAML frontmatter to configure the agent:

```yaml
---
name: my-agent           # matches the agent name used in code
model: opus              # opus | sonnet | haiku — pick based on task complexity
description: >           # when Claude should use this agent (shown in agent picker)
  Use when X. Do not use when Y.
tools:                   # restrict to only the tools this agent needs
  - Read
  - Grep
  - Glob
  - Bash
disableMcpServers: true  # optional: isolate from MCP servers for security-sensitive agents
---
```

Keep `tools:` minimal — an agent that only reads should not have `Write` or `Bash`.
Use `disableMcpServers: true` for agents that handle sensitive code or credentials.

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Add project-specific agents below. Examples: -->
<!-- - **`broadcast-check`** (sonnet) — when adding write operations on real-time resources -->
<!-- - **`enterprise-check`** (opus) — when classifying a feature as open-core vs enterprise -->
<!-- - **`ai-review`** (sonnet) — when a feature must be reachable by an MCP/agent client -->

Generated-contract changes are **not** examples — `generated-artifact-check` ships with
the blueprint. That class costs production incidents in every stack that has it, so it
is not left to be rediscovered.

## Compatibility — pre-1.0

There is no stable public API before 1.0. What must never break, in any release:

- **Generated XML stays importable** — it validates against the current FURS XSDs and passes
  the business rules in *Tax correctness*. A FURS schema update is handled before the next
  filing season, not after users hit it.
- **A change that alters a computed figure for the same input** (a rate rule, a rounding rule,
  lot matching, a field mapping) is a `changed` changelog fragment that says which returns are
  affected, with the source that justifies it.

Until 1.0, CLI flags, configuration and saved-session formats may change, but every change
is in the changelog. **Never rename an env var** without keeping the old name as a deprecated
alias for at least one minor release.

---

## Frontend UI conventions

The web app (`apps/web`) has no design system yet. When one exists, generate
`apps/web/CLAUDE.md` with `/import-design` so `ux-design` and `ux-review` check against it. Until then: Slovenian and
English UI strings come from one message catalog, never inline literals, and every screen is
usable by keyboard alone.
