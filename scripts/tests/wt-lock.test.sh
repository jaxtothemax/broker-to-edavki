# scripts/tests/wt-lock.test.sh — the `wt` issue check-out lock.
#
# The bug: every agent shares one forge identity, so nothing stopped two sessions
# (or two `/batch` waves) from taking the same issue and opening duplicate PRs.
# `wt new` / `wt claim` now apply a `status:wip` label plus a check-out comment and
# refuse an issue that already carries it; `wt remove` / `wt prune` / `wt release`
# clear it.
#
# The forge CLI is stubbed with a small stateful gh, because the sandbox has no
# GitHub. Each positive case has a negative twin: a locked issue is refused but
# --force takes it over; remove clears the label on a CLOSED issue and leaves it on
# an OPEN one; with no forge CLI the worktree is still created.
