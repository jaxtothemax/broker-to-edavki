#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/check-shellcheck.sh — every tracked shell script passes `shellcheck`
# at its default severity (error, warning, info, and style).
#
# ## Why this exists
#
# Every shell file this repo gates with (`scripts/**`) was clean at
# `warning` severity or above. The two files that were not —
# `hooks/pre-commit` and `hooks/pre-push` — were the ones no gate read, and
# they are the two that run on every contributor's machine. `shellcheck`
# would have flagged the bug on day one (SC3020, "In POSIX sh, `&>` is
# undefined", severity `warning`) — see issue #14. A repo whose product is
# shell gate scripts should not be the repo that does not lint its shell.
#
# ## Why this started at `--severity=warning`, not the default
#
# This gate opened with a backlog at the default (every severity, including
# `info` and `style`): two pre-existing `SC2015` (`info`) findings in
# `scripts/customize.sh` (since removed) and `scripts/release-notes.sh`, neither touched by
# the change that added this gate, and neither visible locally — a version
# of the shellcheck binary newer than the CI image's Alpine 3.19 package
# (0.9.0) apparently changed what SC2015 reports at the same severity. Per
# the "stage a backlog by rule severity" rule: block at `error`/`warning`
# from day one (a clean tree today, since that class has none), and promote
# to the default severity in its own change once the info/style backlog is
# cleared — do not ship a new gate `allow_failure` to "be safe" instead.
#
# Issue #27 cleared that backlog: both `SC2015` findings were rewritten as
# explicit `if`/`then` (neither was a live if-then-else bug — both trailing
# `|| true`s exist to force a successful exit regardless of the left side,
# not to run a conditional "else" branch), and a full-repo scan at default
# severity — against both the local shellcheck and the CI image's Alpine
# 3.19 package (0.9.0) — came back with zero findings. This gate has run at
# the default severity, with no staged backlog, since #27.
#
# ## Scope
#
# `scripts/**`, `hooks/**`, `.claude/hooks/**` — the same roots
# check-sigpipe-readers.sh walks, for the same reason: hook output is the
# output nobody reads closely, so bugs there survive longest.
#
# Usage:  scripts/check-shellcheck.sh
#         scripts/check-shellcheck.sh --self-test
# Exit:   0 clean (or shellcheck unavailable) · 1 at least one finding at
#         default severity
