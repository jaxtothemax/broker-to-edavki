# scripts/check-memory-index.sh — size and integrity check for the Claude memory index.
#
# ## Why this exists
#
# The index at `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-repo-path>/memory/MEMORY.md` is loaded into
# context on EVERY turn and has a hard read limit of roughly 24.4 KB. Past it the
# harness loads only part of the file and says so once, in a notice nobody is required
# to read — so indexed memories stop arriving with nothing failing anywhere.
#
# Upstream hit that limit and hand-compacted the index five times in four weeks. Each
# pass bought 1-2 KB and it refilled in about eight days. A recurring manual ritual with
# no check is the exact shape every other scripts/check-*.sh here was written to replace.
#
# Two silent failures, neither visible without looking:
#   1. Over the limit  -> truncated load, memories silently absent.
#   2. A dangling link -> the memory file still exists and is still rankable by its
#      `description:`, but nothing points at it.
#
# ## NOT a pre-push or CI gate, deliberately
#
# Its input is a per-user, per-machine directory outside the repo: it does not exist for
# contributors who do not use Claude Code, nor on CI runners. Only its --self-test runs
# in CI (hermetic, temp dirs only). Run the real check with `make memory-check` at each
# release close, beside `/memory-audit`.
#
# What it cannot do: decide WHICH memories deserve the index. That stays a judgment
# call. This removes the silence, not the possibility of a wrong answer.
#
# ## Usage
#
#   scripts/check-memory-index.sh [--self-test] [--quiet]
#
# ## Exit codes
#
#   0  healthy (or no memory store — skipped)
#   1  over budget, or a dangling link
#   2  bad argument

# Budget sits below the ~24.4 KB read limit so there is room to notice before the
# harness starts truncating.
#
# If this ever fires and the fix looks like "raise the number", keep upstream's order:
# run a full demotion pass FIRST (every entry against "would a session that never opens
# the file still make the right call?"), record what it yielded, and only then move the
# threshold. A floor raised INSTEAD of looking launders a regression; a floor corrected
# AFTER looking is calibration. The two are identical in the diff and opposite in
# meaning. Upstream's pass yielded 310 B against a 1.4 KB shortfall — the content was at
# its natural size and the threshold was what was wrong — and it settled at 23800.
