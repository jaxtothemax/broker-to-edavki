#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/check-nul-bytes.sh — every tracked file git resolves to `text: set`
# must contain zero 0x00 bytes.
#
# ## Why this exists
#
# A literal NUL byte in a tracked file makes git classify the WHOLE FILE as
# binary, regardless of what .gitattributes says: `git diff` prints "Binary
# files a/... and b/... differ" instead of a line, `git grep` finds nothing
# inside it, and a plain `grep -r` sweep across the tree returns a FALSE CLEAN
# rather than an error. Every gate in this repo that walks the tree with
# `grep` — a rename sweep, a stale-reference check, this project's own hygiene
# gates — silently skips that file and reports the tree clean.
#
# Rule: a file the repo EXPLICITLY declares text (`.gitattributes` resolves
# `text` to `set`) must contain no raw 0x00 byte. Two other buckets exist and
# are deliberately OUT of scope, not silently skipped:
#
#   - `unset` (`-text` / `binary`) — a project may mark a path this way on
#     purpose, most often an encoding fixture whose NUL bytes ARE the point
#     (a UTF-16 sample file used to test an import path, say). Flagging those
#     would be flagging the fixture for doing its job.
#   - `auto` (the repo default `* text=auto`, no more specific rule) — `auto`
#     means "let git's own text/binary heuristic decide". A NUL there is
#     git's heuristic working, not a declaration being contradicted. Widening
#     this gate to cover `auto` is a real option but a separate scope
#     decision this gate does not make silently.
#
# Enumeration is from the INDEX (`git ls-files`), never a filesystem walk — a
# tree-walking gate reds `make pre-push` on a gitignored file that was never
# a candidate in the first place.
#
# python3 does the byte scan: reading the file as raw bytes rather than text
# sidesteps any encoding-detection games, and it is available in every image
# this repo's gates already require.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-nul-bytes.sh              # scan the tracked tree
#   scripts/check-nul-bytes.sh --self-test  # prove the check can still fail

A tracked file git resolves to `text: set` contains a literal 0x00 byte. Git
classifies such a file as BINARY no matter what .gitattributes says: `git
diff` prints "Binary files a/... and b/... differ" instead of a readable
diff, `git grep` finds nothing inside it, and a plain `grep` sweep across the
tree silently skips it — a false clean, not an error.

Fix: remove the literal byte. An escape sequence (a Unicode NUL escape in
JS/TS, `\x00` in Python) produces the same runtime value without embedding a
raw byte in the source file, and keeps the file readable as text.

If the NUL is genuinely the point — an encoding fixture, a binary format
misdeclared as text — the fix is in .gitattributes: mark the path `-text` or
`binary` so git (and this gate) stop treating it as text.
