# Broker export formats: eToro, Trade Republic, XTB, DEGIRO and other brokers used in Slovenia

> Researched: 2026-10-07 · Verification: not independently verified
>
> Research for building TaxReporter. It is not tax advice, and FURS publications and the law win over anything written here. Where this page overlaps a verified doc (01–03), the verified doc wins; such places are cross-referenced inline. See the [README](README.md#confidence-and-verification-legend) for the legend.

**Scope.** Brokers used by Slovenian investors, excluding IBKR, Trading 212 and Revolut, which are covered in [06](06-brokers-ibkr-t212-revolut.md). Tax years in scope: 2025 (filed by 2 March 2026) and 2026 (filing season Jan–Feb 2027).

**Confidence notation:** **[H]** means confirmed in a primary source (official help center, legislation, or the source code of a parser that reads real exports). **[M]** means seen in two or more independent secondary sources or in fixtures of a maintained parser. **[L]** means a single secondary source or an inference, so check it against a real export before relying on it.

## 1. Summary

- **Implementation order (ranked by Slovenian usage evidence; §2):** eToro → Trade Republic → XTB → DEGIRO → Lightyear → Freedom24 → Saxo → Bitpanda. Then N26 (PDF-only), followed by Scalable, BUX and flatex, which are effectively unavailable to Slovenian residents.
- **CFDs must be separated from real positions.** eToro and XTB both mix them. CFD and other derivative rows go to **D-IFI**, not Doh-KDVP. Bitpanda's legacy "Stock (derivative)" / "ETF (derivative)" assets are derivative contracts, not shares [H].
- **Recompute EUR yourself.** Most brokers give native-currency price and quantity plus their own EUR (or USD) conversion. Recompute EUR with the Banka Slovenije rate ([03](03-bsi-exchange-rates.md)). Use the broker's converted columns only as a cross-check.
- **Corporate actions.** Several brokers (DEGIRO, Trade Republic `MIGRATION`, Saxo) record splits, ISIN changes and migrations as a sell followed by a buy. These must not become taxable disposals.
- **Domestic brokers need no parser for capital gains.** Slovenian legal persons, and non-residents with a Slovenian branch, that transfer securities must send every acquisition and disposal to FURS by **31 January** (ZDavP-2 Art. 339(3)) [H]. They use the KP_KDVP / KP_IFI XML schemas, and FURS uses that data to pre-fill the taxpayer's Doh-KDVP / D-IFI [H].
- **New in 2025/2026:**
  - Individual investment accounts (INR, under the ZINR act) have existed since **5 March 2026**. Securities held in an INR are not reported per trade and are taxed at withdrawal by the provider [H].
  - The data-delivery regulation was amended twice: Ur. l. 107/2025 (applies to tax year 2025) and Ur. l. 1409/2026 of 9 Sep 2026 (applies to tax year 2026) [H].
  - Trade Republic added a native CSV transaction export in **April 2026** [M].
  - eToro's statement headers changed at least four times between 2024 and Nov 2025 [H, parser source].
  - Bitpanda's derivative stocks became **sell-only "Legacy assets"**, and Bitpanda now offers real securities [H].

## 2. Popularity ranking and evidence

There are no official statistics by broker; FURS does not publish Doh-KDVP counts by broker. The ranking therefore combines several proxies, all observed on 2026-10-07:

| Rank | Broker | Evidence | Best tax export | Parser effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **eToro** | `masbug/etoro-edavki` has 62 ★, second only to `ib-edavki` (316 ★) among Slovenian eDavki converters on GitHub; it was updated Nov 2025 and Feb 2026 for new statement formats. The slo-tech thread "Etoro in Edavki" (t760618) has about 200 posts (2020–2025). Both Slovenian commercial converters support eToro (daveknadobicek.si, edavki.rešitve.si), and money-how.si (Feb 2026) discusses eToro. | Account Statement **XLSX** | High: multiple header versions, CFD split, USD base |
| 2 | **Trade Republic** | Launched in Slovenia in Oct 2022. The slo-tech thread "TradeRepublic" (t825085) has about **1,950 posts**; its latest post on the last page is dated 27 Sep 2026. Žurnal24 has published how-to-file articles on TR interest (2025) and dividends (2026). Supported by both commercial converters. | Native **CSV** (Apr 2026) | Medium |
| 3 | **XTB** | BrokerChooser's 2026 Slovenia ranking puts XTB #4 (after IBKR, MEXEM and T212). No Slovenian open-source converter exists, which is a gap. | Web **XLSX** "Account History" | Medium–High |
| 4 | **DEGIRO** | The slo-tech thread "Degiro online broker…" (t718019) has about 500 posts and was active in 2026. `rmilosic/edavki-xml-converter` converts DEGIRO dividends to Doh-Div. Supported by daveknadobicek.si. | **Transactions.csv + Account.csv** | Medium–High: language variants |
| 5 | **Lightyear** | Officially available to Slovenian residents. Few Slovenia-specific signals. | Transaction report **CSV** | Low–Medium |
| 6 | **Freedom24** | Available in Slovenia [M]; supported by edavki.rešitve.si. | Broker report **JSON** | Medium |
| 7 | **Saxo** | Supported by edavki.rešitve.si. | Transactions **XLSX** | Medium |
| 8 | **Bitpanda** | Mainly used for crypto; stocks are legacy derivatives. | History **CSV** | Medium (tax classification) |
| 9 | N26 (Upvest) | Stocks/ETFs available in Slovenia [H]; daveknadobicek.si supports it. Exports are PDF only. | PDF order confirmations | Out of scope for deterministic CSV parsing |
| — | Scalable, BUX, flatex | Scalable accepts only residents of DE, AT, IT, ES, FR and NL. BUX serves AT, BE, FR, DE, IE, IT, NL and ES. flatex is DACH-focused. | — | Only for people who moved to Slovenia |

## 3. Cross-cutting parser rules

1. **Detect columns by header text, never by position.**
   - DEGIRO uses *empty* header cells for currency columns (`Price,,Local value,,`).
   - eToro, DEGIRO, XTB and Freedom24 localize headers or values to the UI language.
   - XTB sheets have banner rows above the header: on the closed-positions sheet the header is on row 13.
2. **Accept both number locales.**
   - eToro EN uses `1,071.56` with dot decimals.
   - DEGIRO with an NL/PT/ES UI uses quoted values with a comma decimal (`"-290,00"`).
   - Scalable uses `98,5`.
   - Saxo mixes the two: price inside `Event` uses a dot, while `Amount` may be `"419,22"`.
3. **Date formats.**

   | Broker | Format |
   |---|---|
   | eToro | `DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS`, or `DD.MM.YYYY HH:MM:SS` together with decimal commas |
   | DEGIRO | `DD-MM-YYYY` with a separate `HH:MM` time column |
   | XTB | Excel serial numbers in XLSX (e.g. `45716.648060671301`); `DD.MM.YYYY HH:MM:SS` in CSV/text |
   | Lightyear | `DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS` |
   | Trade Republic | ISO-8601 UTC `datetime` plus a local `date` |
   | Bitpanda | ISO-8601 with offset |
   | Freedom24 | `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` |
   | Saxo | `DD-Mon-YYYY` |

   Use the local trade **date**, not the UTC date, for the BSI rate lookup.
4. **Route by asset class.**
   - Real share/ETF/fund → Doh-KDVP.
   - CFD or other derivative → D-IFI.
   - Crypto → excluded from both. The 25% crypto-gains bill (ZDDKS) was withdrawn from the December 2025 parliamentary agenda, so it is not law for 2026 [M].
   - The derivatives-gains act (ZDDOIFI) was amended in Oct 2025 to a flat 25% regardless of holding period [M]. The effective date is confirmed in [04 §2.4](04-si-tax-rules.md#24-contrast-derivatives-under-zddoifi-filed-on-doh-ifi-not-doh-kdvp) (verified): ZDDOIFI-B (UL 85/2025) applies the flat 25% to tax years from 1 Jan 2026, and deletes the holding-period scale and the 20-year exemption.
5. **Dividends.**
   - Doh-Div needs gross amount, foreign tax, payer identification and source country. No broker export contains the payer's address or tax number, so the app needs an enrichment table keyed by ISIN (as `masbug/etoro-edavki` does with `Company_info.xlsx`).
   - Several brokers emit one dividend row per position or partial lot (eToro per Position ID, XTB per lot). Aggregate them per payer and per day. **Sources conflict here:** FURS requires one `Dividend` record per payment on the evidence and has rejected a return that summed two same-day payments ([02 §5](02-furs-doh-div-and-others.md#5-one-record-per-payment-and-payer-ids), verified). Whether per-position fragments of one corporate payment may be merged is not settled by any source, so treat this aggregation as an open question, not a rule.
6. **Fees.** Commission, FX/AutoFX, spread, SDRT/FTT/TOB and overnight fees appear in different columns or as separate cash rows. Keep them typed so the tax engine can apply the cost policy.
7. **Full history.** FIFO needs every acquisition, so ask for an export "since account opening". eToro additionally needs Account Activity rows to map Position ID → ticker (`masbug` aborts if the mapping is missing).

## 4. Per-broker reference

### 4.1 eToro

**Export path.** Portfolio → History (clock icon) → settings cog → *Account statement* → choose start/end date → XLS icon [H, `masbug` README]. In 2021 eToro moved it under Settings → Account → "View" next to Account Statement, with presets such as "Last Year" [M].

> **Corrections (2026-10-11, #8).** An evidence review for the eToro adapter (ADR 0020) checked
> this section against `masbug/etoro-edavki` pinned at commit
> `5f607d9e99334939875e5cf92f3a1d55b9b04a20` (MIT), seven other parsers and the one published
> statement (below). It corrected: `Action` often has no verb; the withholding rate is also
> written `10 %`; some statements lack the EUR columns; and each claim now carries its
> evidence tag. The header tables below are quoted from that commit.

> **A real export (2026-10-21, #8).** The owner exported their own account statement as XLSX,
> through Settings → Account → Account Statement, for 1 to 20 October 2026. The account has
> never had any activity. It is committed anonymized as
> `packages/brokers/test/fixtures/etoro/2026-10-no-activity.xlsx`, with only the name, username
> and creation date replaced. What it shows [H for this one export]:
>
> - One click on the XLS icon downloads the whole workbook, whichever tab is open.
> - It has **six sheets**: the five below and a sixth, `Glossary`, of plain-language
>   definitions with no figure ("Account Statement Glossary", grouped by the statement's
>   sections). No earlier source mentions it.
> - Its data sheets' headers are exactly Closed Positions 2025.2.15 (with `Profit(EUR)`),
>   Account Activity 2025.2 and Dividends 2025.11 (with the EUR columns), in the order the
>   tables below give.
> - A sheet with no row keeps its header row, and nothing under it.
> - Each table is an Excel table part (`xl/tables/`), and the workbook has no `absPath`. It
>   was written by the Open XML SDK (`x:` prefixes, a `package/services/metadata` part),
>   though `docProps/app.xml` names Microsoft Excel.
> - `Account Summary` writes its amounts as number cells, and its period day first
>   (`01/10/2026 00:00:00` to `20/10/2026 23:59:59`). The downloaded file's name writes the
>   same period month first (`10-1-2026-10-20-2026`).

**Workbook.** Formats are PDF and XLS(X). The XLSX has five sheets: `Account Summary`, `Closed Positions`, `Account Activity` (formerly "Transactions Report"), `Dividends` and `Financial Summary` [M], and in the export of 2026-10-21 a sixth, `Glossary` [H]. The data sheets have their header on row 1; `Account Summary` has a preamble (name, username, currency, the account's creation date and the statement's dates), with its table's header on row 10 [H]. `Account Summary` holds the holder's **Name and Username**, so a reader should never open it.

- Sheet names and headers are translated with the UI language. The Spanish export uses `Posiciones cerradas`, `Actividad de la cuenta` and `Dividendos`, with headers such as `Acción`, `Ganancias (EUR)` and `Tipo de cambio de apertura (USD)` [M].
- Use the **XLSX**; the PDF is for humans.

**`Closed Positions` header history** (verbatim from `masbug/etoro-edavki` at `5f607d9`, versions dated by the maintainer) [H for the header text; the maintainer's dates M]:

| Version | Columns |
|---|---|
| 2024 | `Position ID, Action, Amount, Units, Open Date, Close Date, Leverage, Spread Fees (USD), Profit(USD), Profit(EUR), Open Rate, Close Rate, Take profit rate, Stop lose rate, Rollover Fees and Dividends, Copied From, Type, ISIN, Notes` |
| 2024.7 | adds `Long / Short`, `Market Spread (USD)`; `Rollover…` → `Overnight Fees and Dividends` |
| 2024.8 | adds `FX rate at open (USD)`, `FX rate at close (USD)` before `Open Rate` |
| 2025.1 | `Stop lose rate` → `Stop loss rate`; **ISIN removed** |
| 2025.2 | `Units` → `Units / Contracts` |
| 2025.2.15 (current) | `Position ID, Action, Long / Short, Amount, Units / Contracts, Open Date, Close Date, Leverage, Spread Fees (USD), Market Spread (USD), Profit(USD), Profit(EUR), FX rate at open (USD), FX rate at close (USD), Open Rate, Close Rate, Take profit rate, Stop loss rate, Overnight Fees and Dividends, Copied From, Type, ISIN, Notes` (**ISIN restored**) |

**`Account Activity`** [H]:

| Version | Columns |
|---|---|
| 2022 | `Date, Type, Details, Amount, Realized Equity Change, Realized Equity, Balance, Position ID, NWA` |
| 2023 | adds `Units` and `Asset type` |
| 2025.2 | `Date, Type, Details, Amount, Units / Contracts, Realized Equity Change, Realized Equity, Balance, Position ID, Asset type, NWA` |

**`Dividends`** [H]:

| Version | Columns |
|---|---|
| 2024 | `Date of Payment, Instrument Name, Net Dividend Received (USD), Net Dividend Received (EUR), Withholding Tax Rate (%), Withholding Tax Amount (USD), Withholding Tax Amount (EUR), Position ID, Type, ISIN` |
| 2025.1 | ISIN removed |
| 2025.11 | `Date of Payment, Instrument Name, Net Dividend Received (USD), Net dividends, Currency, Franked/Unfranked, Franking Credits (AUD), Net Dividend Received (EUR), Withholding Tax Rate (%), Withholding Tax Amount (USD), Withholding Tax Amount (EUR), Position ID, Type, ISIN` |

**Values and enumerations:**

- `Action` is often the instrument's name and ticker with no verb, `"Apple (AAPL)"` [M]; older sources show `"Buy <instrument name>"` / `"Sell <instrument name>"` [L]. Read the direction from `Long / Short`, never from `Action`. The ticker comes from Account Activity `Details` = `"AAPL/USD"` (ticker/quote currency), joined on `Position ID` [H, `masbug`].
- `Long / Short` ∈ {`Long`, `Short`} [H].
- `Type` (closed positions) seen: `Stocks`, `ETF`, `Crypto`, `CFD` [M]. The `masbug` derivative list also contains `OPT`, `FUT`, `FOP` and `Crypto Margin` [H for the list]. Commodity, currency and index rows are always CFDs [M].
- Account Activity `Type` seen: `Open Position`, `Position closed`, `Dividend`, `Overnight fee`, `Overnight refund`, `Interest Payment`, `SDRT`, `Withdraw Request`, `Withdraw Fee`, `Withdrawal Conversion Fee` [M]; other parsers also name `Deposit`, `Adjustment`, `Commission`, `corp action: Split`, `Staking`, `AirDrop` and cancellations of withdrawals and fees [L].
- `"-"` marks N/A, including the FX columns for USD-quoted instruments, `Copied From`, and a cash row's `Units` and `Position ID` [M].
- The withholding rate is written `15%` or, in the published statement, `10 %` with a space [M].
- **Cell kinds are mixed** [M, the published statement]: dates, `Position ID`, `Units / Contracts`, `Leverage` and the rate are text, while `Amount`, the rates and the profit are number cells; the same column can be text on one sheet and a number on another (a closing row's units, `1.6506190000000001`, against `1.650619` as text), so a reader takes both and rounds a number cell to 15 digits.
- **Dates** are text `DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS` (`DD/MM/YYYY` for a payment date); a Slovenian locale writes `DD.MM.YYYY` with decimal commas [M]; one source says Excel serials [L]. A Spanish fixture writes negatives in brackets [M, DeclaRenta], and `Account Summary` says "Values shown in brackets indicate negative amounts" [M].

**CFD vs real.** A row is a derivative (→ D-IFI) when any of these holds:

- `Type` is one of the derivative types above;
- `Leverage > 1`;
- `Long / Short` = `Short` (in the EU a real asset is only a long, 1× position) [M].

`masbug` rejects rows with leverage > 1 whose type is a real-asset type. For leveraged CFDs, `Amount` is the margin; the notional is `Amount × Leverage`.

**Currency.**

- `Amount`, `Profit(USD)`, spread and fee columns are in USD (the account base).
- `Open Rate` / `Close Rate` are in the **instrument's** currency. `FX rate at open/close (USD)` converts that currency to USD.
- For EUR- or GBP-quoted instruments, convert the native price with the BSI rate for that currency. For EUR instruments no conversion is needed. Avoid `masbug`'s detour (native → USD via eToro's rate → EUR via BSI), which adds error.
- Since Oct 2024 EU users can fund trades from a EUR balance [H, press release]. The 2025.11 `Net dividends` + `Currency` columns are the native-currency amounts [L].
- Since 2026-02-17 `masbug` prices a trade as `Open Rate` × `FX rate at open (USD)` (`-` read as 1), then converts USD at the BSI rate; before that it derived prices from `Amount`, `Units` and `Profit` and called the rates "bogus" [H, `masbug` history]. How a GBX price is written is unknown [L].

**Dividends.**

- There is no gross column: gross = net + WHT. `Net Dividend Received (USD)` is net of the tax withheld [M]: in the published statement, 0.11 net with 0.0122 withheld at "10 %" gives a gross of 0.1222.
- Rows are per position, so aggregate them (but see the conflict noted in §3, rule 5).
- ISIN is absent from statements exported between roughly Jan and Feb 2025.

**Pitfalls:**

- Five header revisions in 18 months; `masbug` fixes its parser almost every season.
- Partial closes and copy-trading positions (`Copied From`).
- Crypto rows (exclude).
- `Open Date` must come from full history.
- The statement time zone is not documented. Timestamps of market opens (14:31 for New York, 07:01 for Paris) suggest UTC [L]. Account Activity books dividends around midnight (00:03 to 00:45 in the published statement), so a reader that guesses the zone can put a dividend on the wrong day [M].
- Partial closes: how they are recorded is unknown [L].

**The published statement.** `nra-assist.com` publishes an example
(`https://nra-assist.com/help/brokers/etoro/etoro-example.xlsx`, SHA-256 `ed0c91a1…`), the
only real-looking statement found [M]. It was **saved again by a third party** (it has an
`absPath`, which eToro's exporter does not write; its table parts do not show it, as the
real export of 2026-10-21 has them too) and is **not an untouched export**:

- dated 2025-09-20, covering 2024, it lacks `Profit(EUR)` and the dividends' EUR columns;
- its first Account Activity row already shows a realized equity of 4291.25, so it does not
  start at the account's opening;
- it pays dividends on positions with no `Open Position` row (an Exxon dividend among them);
- it keeps the cell kinds, dates and dividend times described above.

A reader cannot be verified on it; it can only show shapes.

### 4.2 Trade Republic

**Availability and history.** Available in Slovenia since the Oct 2022 expansion [M]. Until 2026 TR offered only PDFs: per-transaction confirmations and an annual "Tax report" (Profile → Tax Reports) that Slovenian users attach to FURS filings [M]. Money-how.si (Feb 2026) still describes TR as PDF-only.

**CSV export (April 2026)** [M]: Profile → Account statements → **Transaction export** → *All transactions* or a period → Create → Download. It is reported to be app-only. One file covers the securities account, the cash account and crypto. `GhostfolioSidekick` added its parser on 2026-04-17.

**Two header revisions, 23 columns each** [H]. Updated 2026-10-10 from the six exports that [Portfolio Performance's importer is tested on](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/tree/96f6040818d5b5e8aeaca63e60e7e6857b4befa2/name.abuchen.portfolio.tests/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/datatransfer/traderepublic) (pinned at `96f6040`, EPL-1.0, read and never copied), which look real: real ISINs, German residents' tax rows, and two transaction IDs (export 05) that are UUIDv7 whose time matches their row's `datetime`; the other 361 IDs are v4, which an anonymizer may have written. Which revision is the older is not known: export 01 holds rows from 2021, but its file is undated. Recorded in [ADR 0019](../adr/0019-trade-republic-export-revisions-and-row-types.md).

- **Comma revision**, quoted (exports 02–04) or not (05, 06):

  ```text
  "datetime","date","account_type","category","type","asset_class","name","symbol","shares","price","amount","fee","tax","currency","original_amount","original_currency","fx_rate","description","transaction_id","counterparty_name","counterparty_iban","payment_reference","mcc_code"
  ```

- **Semicolon revision**, unquoted (export 01, 339 rows from 2021 to 2026): the same columns with `value_date` after `transaction_id` and no `mcc_code`:

  ```text
  datetime;date;account_type;category;type;asset_class;name;symbol;shares;price;amount;fee;tax;currency;original_amount;original_currency;fx_rate;description;transaction_id;value_date;counterparty_name;counterparty_iban;payment_reference
  ```

  Its descriptions hold commas, so only the header line tells the delimiter. Every `datetime` is `<date>T00:00:00.000000Z`, a placeholder rather than a time. `value_date` is the settlement: two business days after `date` on 148 of 162 purchases (two to six calendar days), the same day on the 14 of crypto, and before `date` on the tax-base rows.

**Enumerations** ([M] from parser fixtures; [H] where the exports above show them):

- `account_type`: `DEFAULT`; `JUNIOR`, a child's account [H].
- `category`: `TRADING`, `CASH`, `CORPORATE_ACTION`, `DELIVERY`.
- `type`:
  - trading: `BUY`, `SELL`, `SAVINGS_PLAN_EXECUTED` (the semicolon revision writes savings plans as `BUY` [H])
  - income: `DIVIDEND`, `DISTRIBUTION` (a fund's), `INTEREST_PAYMENT` (cash interest, or a bond's coupon on a row naming the bond) [H]
  - `DIVIDEND_EQUIVALENT_PAYMENT`, described as "Capital Distribution": a return of capital [H]
  - rewards: `BENEFITS_SAVEBACK` (a cash row with no security in export 01, followed the next day by a purchase of the same amount [H]), `STOCKPERK`, `BONUS`
  - card: `CARD_TRANSACTION`, `CARD_TRANSACTION_INTERNATIONAL`
  - transfers: `CUSTOMER_INBOUND`, `CUSTOMER_INPAYMENT`, `CUSTOMER_OUTBOUND_REQUEST`, `TRANSFER_INSTANT_INBOUND`, `TRANSFER_INSTANT_OUTBOUND`, and [H] `TRANSFER_IN`, `TRANSFER_OUT`, `TRANSFER_INBOUND`; `TRANSFER_DIRECT_DEBIT_INBOUND` is always money out, a direct debit [M, [libtraderepublic](https://github.com/aritzmmartinez/libtraderepublic) SCHEMA.md]
  - `GIFT`: cash only, either sign, in export 01 [H]
  - German tax [H]: `TAX_OPTIMIZATION` (a German tax refund or charge, cash, `amount` 0), `EARNINGS` (the Vorabpauschale, [InvStG §18](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/invstg_2018/__18.html), on a fund, `amount` 0) and `PRE_DETERMINED_TAX_BASE` (its tax base, likewise)
  - bonds and derivatives [H]: `SEC_ACCOUNT` (bond), `TILG` (a derivative's redemption), and as corporate actions `REDEMPTION`, `FINAL_MATURITY`, `WARRANT_EXERCISE`, `SPLIT`
  - other: `MIGRATION`, `PRIVATE_MARKET_BUY`
- `asset_class`: `STOCK`, `FUND`, `BOND`, `PRIVATE_FUND`, `CRYPTO` (symbol a ticker such as `BTC`, not an ISIN) and `DERIVATIVE` [H]; `SYNTHETIC`, a gold certificate [M, libtraderepublic].
- `symbol` holds the **ISIN**, except for crypto.

**Formats.**

- Dot decimals; `shares` has 10 decimal places (fractional savings plans); sells carry negative `shares`. `amount` has 2 or 6 decimals, `price` 6 or 10.
- `amount` is the signed cash flow and `fee` is negative. On every share, fund and crypto trade of the exports `amount` is gross, quantity times price within a cent, with the fee and tax beside it (174 of 179 trades in export 01; the other 5 are bond purchases with accrued interest) [H].
- `tax` on a trade appears on five fund sales of export 01 (German capital-gains tax) [H]; libtraderepublic reports it on some purchases too [M].
- In the comma revision `datetime` is UTC (`…Z`, with 0, 3 or 6 fractional digits) and `date` the local Berlin date: `2024-02-14T23:19:02Z` belongs to `2024-02-15`. **Not always:** dividend corrections in export 04 were booked at 12:17 UTC on 28 March and carry `date` 27 March [H]. Some cash rows of the comma revision also carry a bare midnight (`2026-03-13T00:00:00Z`, exports 02 and 06) [H].

**Dividends** [H for the arithmetic, from exports 01, 04 and 05]:

- `amount` is the gross in euros at Trade Republic's rate: `original_amount` × `fx_rate` (34.51 USD × 0.857265 = 29.58; 479.34 NOK × 0.086745 = 41.58). `original_amount` is the gross in the paying currency, and `fx_rate` is euros per unit of it, the inverse of a BSI quote. A euro dividend leaves all three empty.
- `tax` is what Trade Republic withheld, in euros. **In these German residents' exports it includes German tax** (Aker, 15.53 on 41.58: 37%, above Norway's 25%), so what it holds for a Slovenian resident is still unknown.
- A correction comes as a reversal (negative `amount`, positive `tax`) and a rebooking, up to a year after the payment, with a `date` of its own.

**Pitfalls:**

- `MIGRATION` comes as a −n/+n pair; it is not a disposal.
- Saveback paid as cash is a cash row with no security, followed by an ordinary purchase of the same amount (export 01: +0.09 on 1 March, a 0.09 `BUY` the next day) [H]: card cashback, then a purchase at market price. A Saveback or stock-perk row that names a security is a free share, whose cost basis is a tax question.
- `tax` on a sale in German residents' exports is German tax. Whether any of it could be credited on Doh-KDVP (`HasForeignTax`, research 04 §3; ZDoh-2 art. 137(2) limits a credit to the treaty's rate) depends on what the Slovenia–Germany treaty allows Germany on gains from shares, which this research has not yet read (#58).
- A Slovenian resident's dividend `tax` is unconfirmed: see above. Verify against TR's dividend PDF.
- Filter out card and transfer noise by `category`, and take a cash type only on a row with no security.
- Descriptions and counterparty columns hold names and IBANs (`Outgoing transfer for <name> (<IBAN>)`).

### 4.3 XTB

**Export** [H, XTB help center, updated 2026-07-31]:

- Web: *Account History* tab → closed positions, cash operations, orders → download in **Excel** format.
- Mobile: Profile → Transaction History → arrow icon → *New Report* → date range → account → *Generate Report* → *Report History*.

**XLSX structure** (real export, Mar 2025) [H]. Some sheets start at column B; header row positions shift with the banner.

| Sheet | Header row | Columns |
|---|---|---|
| `CLOSED POSITION HISTORY` | 13 | `Position, Symbol, Type, Volume, Open time, Open price, Close time, Close price, Open origin, Close origin, Purchase value, Sale value, SL, TP, Margin, Commission, Swap, Rollover, Gross P/L, Comment` |
| `OPEN POSITION <DDMMYYYY>` | 11 | `Position, Symbol, Type, Volume, Open time, Open price, Market price, Purchase value, SL, TP, Margin, Commission, Swap, Rollover, Gross P/L, Comment` |
| `PENDING ORDERS HISTORY ` (note the trailing space) | 11 | `ID, Symbol, Purchase value, Nominal Value, Price, Margin, Type, Order, side, SL, TP, Open time` |
| `CASH OPERATION HISTORY` | 11 | `ID, Type, Time, Comment, Symbol, Amount` |
| MT4/MT5 accounts only: `CLOSED POSITION HISTORY MT`, `BALANCE OPERATION HISTORY MT` | — | — |

**Older CSV export.** The cash-operations column order is `ID;Type;Time;Symbol;Comment;Amount` (semicolon; Symbol *before* Comment) [M].

**Values:**

- Closed-position `Type` ∈ {`BUY`, `SELL`}.
- Times are Excel serials in XLSX and `DD.MM.YYYY HH:MM:SS` in CSV.
- `Open price`/`Close price` are in the instrument currency; `Purchase value`, `Sale value`, `Gross P/L` and all cash amounts are in the **account currency** (normally EUR for Slovenian clients) [M].

**Cash-operation `Type` values** (the spelling varies by period and language) [M]:

- Purchases/sales: `Stocks/ETF purchase` / `Stocks/ETF sale` (older: `Stock purchase` / `Stock sale`).
- Dividends: `DIVIDENT` (sic) or `Dividend`.
- Withholding: `Withholding Tax` or `Withholding tax`.
- Interest: `Free-funds Interest` / `Free funds interests`, and `Free-funds Interest Tax` / `Free funds interests tax`.
- Other: `SEC fee`, `close trade`, `Profit/Loss (FX/CFD)`, `swap` / `Swap`, `tax IFTT`, `Spin off`, `Transfer`, `deposit`, `withdrawal`, `Inactivity Fee`.
- Localized UIs translate the types too, for example Portuguese `Ações/ETF compra` / `Ações/ETF vende`.

**`Comment` formats:**

- Trades: `OPEN BUY 3 @ 190.00`, `CLOSE BUY 3 @ 217.00`.
- Partial fill of a fractional order: `OPEN BUY 34/42.5658 @ 11.7480`.
- Dividend: `AAPL.US USD 0.2600/ SHR`.
- Withholding: `AAPL.US USD WHT 15%`.
- Interest: `Free-funds Interest 2026-07`.
- Corrections start with `Corr `.

**CFD vs real.** Real stocks and ETFs have exchange-suffixed symbols (`.US`, `.DE`, `.UK`, `.PL`, `.FR`, `.NL`…), `Margin = 0` and non-zero `Purchase value`. CFDs (`US500`, `EURUSD`, `GOLD`, `OIL`…) have `Margin > 0` and empty or zero purchase/sale value, and their P/L appears as `close trade` / `Profit/Loss (FX/CFD)` cash rows [M]. Route CFDs to D-IFI.

**Pitfalls:**

- Dividends and WHT can be split into several rows for the same symbol and time.
- WHT can be **positive** (reversal).
- Interest corrections arrive as separate rows.
- Every `Stocks/ETF purchase/sale` cash row duplicates a position row; use positions for trades and cash ops only for income and fees.
- Fractional volumes.

**Synthetic sample (`CASH OPERATION HISTORY`):**

```text
ID	Type	Time	Comment	Symbol	Amount
900000002	DIVIDENT	15.05.2026 10:02:11	AAPL.US USD 0.2600/ SHR	AAPL.US	0.67
900000003	Withholding Tax	15.05.2026 10:02:11	AAPL.US USD WHT 15%	AAPL.US	-0.10
900000004	Stocks/ETF sale	14.07.2026 15:40:55	CLOSE BUY 3 @ 217.00	AAPL.US	556.47
```

### 4.4 DEGIRO (flatexDEGIRO)

**Availability.** Slovenian residents are accepted through a non-Slovenian entity; there is no Slovenian site [L].

**Exports** [M]:

- Inbox → **Transactions** (CSV / Excel / PDF).
- Inbox → **Account statement** (CSV / Excel / PDF).
- Portfolio → Export.
- *Annual report* (PDF only).
- Trades come only from Transactions; dividends, WHT, FTT/TOB, ADR fees and interest come only from Account. **Both files are required.**

**`Transactions.csv`**:

| Variant | Header |
|---|---|
| Current EN (2023+) [M] | `Date,Time,Product,ISIN,Reference exchange,Venue,Quantity,Price,,Local value,,Value EUR,Exchange rate,AutoFX Fee,Transaction and/or third party fees EUR,Total EUR,Order ID,` (note the trailing comma) |
| Spanish equivalent | `Fecha,Hora,Producto,ISIN,Bolsa de referencia,Centro de ejecución,Número,Precio,,Valor local,,Valor EUR,Tipo de cambio,Comisión AutoFX,Costes de transacción y/o externos EUR,Total EUR,ID Orden,` |
| Legacy 19-column (NL) | `Datum,Tijd,Product,ISIN,Beurs,Uitvoeringsplaats,Aantal,Koers,,Lokale waarde,,Waarde,,Wisselkoers,Transactiekosten en/of kosten van derden,,Totaal,,Order ID` (currency in a blank-header column after each amount) |

In recent files the order UUID often sits in the **unnamed trailing column**, leaving `Order ID` empty [M]. Detect UUIDs instead of trusting the header.

**`Account.csv`** [M]:

- EN: `Date,Time,Value date,Product,ISIN,Description,FX,Change,,Balance,,Order Id`
- NL: `Datum,Tijd,Valutadatum,Product,ISIN,Omschrijving,FX,Mutatie,,Saldo,,Order Id`
- PT: `Data,Hora,Data Valor,Produto,ISIN,Descrição,T.,Mudança,,Saldo,,ID da Ordem`
- ES: `Fecha,Hora,Fecha valor,Producto,ISIN,Descripción,Tipo,Variación,,Saldo,,ID Orden`
- German headers were not verified.

**`Description` values (EN):**

- Trades: `Buy 4 CONSTELLATION ENERGY CORP@244 USD (US21037T1097)`, `Sell …`.
- Dividends: `Dividend`, `Dividend Tax`, `Fund Distribution`.
- FX legs: `FX Credit`, `FX Debit`.
- Fees: `DEGIRO Transaction and/or third party fees`, `DEGIRO Exchange Connection Fee 2026 (Nasdaq - NDQ)`.
- Cash: `Flatex Interest Income`, `Degiro Cash Sweep Transfer`, `Money Market fund conversion: Buy 0.5 at 1 GBP`.
- Translated equivalents: NL `Koop`/`Verkoop`/`Dividendbelasting`, PT `Compra`/`Venda`, ES `Dividendo`/`Retención del dividendo`.

**FX convention.** `Exchange rate` = foreign units per 1 EUR, so `Value EUR = Local value / Exchange rate`. Example: −976.00 USD / 1.1564 = −844.00 EUR. This is the same quoting convention as BSI/ECB, but it is DEGIRO's dealing rate, so recompute with BSI.

**Pitfalls:**

- One order is split into several rows with the same Order ID, and the fee sits on one row only.
- ISIN changes, splits and share swaps appear as **orderless, cost-free sell + buy pairs** in Transactions [M]. Treat them as non-taxable continuations (keep the original cost and date) unless the event is a taxable exchange.
- Delimiter (comma or semicolon) and decimal format follow the UI locale.
- GBX prices.

### 4.5 Lightyear

**Availability.** Officially available to Slovenian residents [H].

**Statements** [H] (PDF; mobile: Transactions → Statements; web: profile → Settings → Account):

- *Account*.
- *Income*: in the entity currency, with end-of-day FX.
- *Capital gains*: FIFO or Average cost. Pick **FIFO** for Slovenia.
- *Cost & charges* (ex-post).

**CSV "Transaction report"** (app or web Activities → download/export CSV) [M]:

```text
Date,Reference,Ticker,ISIN,Type,Quantity,CCY,Price/share,Gross Amount,FX Rate,Fee,Net Amt.,Tax Amt.
```

**Values:**

- `Type` ∈ {`Buy`, `Sell`, `Dividend`, `Distribution`, `Interest`, `Reward`, `Conversion`, `Deposit`, `Withdrawal`}.
- Reference prefixes: `OR-` (order), `DD-` (dividend), `IN-` (interest/distribution), `CN-` (conversion), `DT-` (deposit), `WL-` (withdrawal), `RW-` (reward).
- Dates `DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS`; quantity has 9 decimal places.
- FX conversions appear as two `Conversion` rows (one per currency) with the fee on the EUR leg.

**Dividends.** Gross = `Gross Amount` and WHT = `Tax Amt.`. Lightyear files W-8BEN automatically, so Slovenian residents get **15%** US withholding [H]. For EU/UK instruments, non-treaty rates are withheld (e.g. FR 25%, BE 30%, DK 27%) and treaty relief is not applied [H].

**Pitfall.** Money-market "Savings" funds (e.g. `BRICEKSP`, `ICSUSSDP`) produce `Distribution` rows and frequent buy/sell churn.

### 4.6 Freedom24 (Freedom Finance Europe)

**Export.** Client area → Reports → **Broker report** → period → PDF / XLS(X) / **JSON** / XML [M]. The JSON comes from the same Tradernet back end as other Freedom entities [H, real fixture], so prefer JSON.

**JSON structure** [H]:

- Top level: `report.{date_start, date_end, plainAccountInfoData{client_code, base_currency, …}, trades{detailed[], securities, total}, corporate_actions{detailed[], total}, cash_flows{detailed[], total}, commissions, securities_in_outs, cash_in_outs, account_at_start, account_at_end, …}`.
- `trades.detailed[]`: `trade_id, date ("YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"), short_date, pay_d (settlement), instr_nm (e.g. AAPL.US), instr_type, instr_kind, issue_nb, isin, operation (buy|sell), p, curr_c, q, summ, profit, fifo_profit, commission, commission_currency, mkt_name, order_id, broker ("FFEU"), id ("trade/order")`.
- `corporate_actions.detailed[]`: `date, type (localized, e.g. "Дивиденды"), type_id (dividend|dividend_compensation|…), amount, amount_per_one, ticker, isin, currency, ex_date, external_tax, external_tax_currency, tax_amount (negative or "-"), tax_currency, comment, q_on_ex_date`. A Polish tax tool also handles `type` ∈ {`Dividends`, `Conversion`, `Split`}.
- `cash_flows.detailed[]`: `date, account, sum ("-0.47 USD"), amount, currency, type (localized), type_id (tax|…), comment`.

**Pitfalls:**

- Branch on `type_id`, never on the localized `type`.
- `commission_currency` can differ from `curr_c`.
- `dividend_compensation` rows are short or repo positions paying the dividend.
- Withholding appears both in `tax_amount` and as a `cash_flows` `tax` row, so do not double count.

### 4.7 Saxo

**Export.** Profile → *Transaction overview* → Export → **Excel** (single sheet; "Transaktioner" for Danish users) [M].

**Columns** (variant A, the Transactions export) [M]:

```text
Client ID,Trade Date,Value Date,Type,Instrument,Instrument ISIN,Instrument currency,Exchange Description,Instrument Symbol,Event,Amount,Order ID,Conversion Rate
```

**Values:**

- `Type` ∈ {`Trade`, `Corporate action`, `Cash amount`, …}.
- `Event` examples: `Buy 3 @ 190.00 USD` / `Sell …` (Danish `Købt` / `Solgt`), `Dividend` / `Cash dividend`, `Custody Fee`.
- `Instrument Symbol` looks like `AAPL:xnas`.
- `Amount` is in the account currency; `Conversion Rate` converts instrument currency to account currency.
- Dates look like `03-Feb-2026`.

**Variant B** (another Saxo export) uses `Transaction Type`, `Booked Amount`, `Total cost` and `Currency` [L].

**Pitfall.** Split rows carry no share count. How withholding is presented for dividends is unverified [L].

### 4.8 Bitpanda

**Export.** User icon/Profile → History → Export → CSV or PDF, or Reports and Statements → Transaction history [H]. Dedicated tax reports exist for Austria only [H].

**CSV layout.**

- About 6 preamble lines: disclaimer; name, DOB; e-mail; `Account opened at: …`; `Venue: Bitpanda`; `Reported by Bitpanda GmbH`.
- Then the header [M]:

  ```text
  Transaction ID,Timestamp,Transaction Type,In/Out,Amount Fiat,Fiat,Amount Asset,Asset,Asset market price,Asset market price currency,Asset class,Product ID,Fee,Fee asset,Spread,Spread Currency,Tax Fiat
  ```

- `Tax Fiat` is newer; 2022 files have 16 columns.
- Legacy v1 header: `ID,Type,In/Out,Amount Fiat,Fee,Fiat,Amount Asset,Asset,Status,Created at`.

**Values:**

- `Asset class` ∈ {`Fiat`, `Cryptocurrency`, `Stock (derivative)`, `ETF (derivative)`, `Commodity`, `Metal`}.
- `Transaction Type` ∈ {`deposit`, `withdrawal`, `buy`, `sell`, `transfer`, `rewards`, `transfer(stake)`…}.
- `-` means N/A; timestamps are ISO with offset.
- **There is no ISIN.** Map instruments via `Product ID` + `Asset`.
- Rely on `Transaction Type`; the `In/Out` direction is inconsistent across samples [L].

**Tax classification.** Bitpanda states that **Legacy assets (A-Token, derivative contracts)** give exposure without ownership and are now **sell-only**. It also introduced **Real Securities** (real stocks, ETFs and ETCs; €1 per trade; executed on the Quotrix exchange) [H].

- Legacy derivative rows should be treated as derivatives (D-IFI) unless a FURS position says otherwise [L].
- The `Asset class` label used for Real Securities is unconfirmed [L].

### 4.9 N26, Scalable, BUX, flatex

- **N26 Stocks/ETFs** are custodied by Upvest Securities GmbH and available in Slovenia [H]. Documents are limited to ex-ante cost disclosures and order confirmations (PDF), which are not machine-friendly.
- **Scalable** CSV (for movers): `date;time;status;reference;description;assetType;type;isin;shares;price;amount;fee;tax;currency`.
  - `status` ∈ {`Executed`, `Pending`, `Cancelled`}; skip anything not Executed.
  - `type` ∈ {`Buy`, `Sell`, `Savings plan`, `Distribution`, `Interest`, `Deposit`, `Withdrawal`}; `assetType` ∈ {`Security`, `Cash`}.
  - Decimal comma [M].
- **flatex** (DE/AT) uses two `;`-separated files: `Nummer;Buchtag;Valuta;ISIN;Bezeichnung;Nominal;;Buchungsinformationen;TA-Nr.;Kurs;;Depot` and `Buchtag;Valuta;BIC / BLZ;IBAN / Kontonummer;Buchungsinformationen;TA-Nr.;Betrag;;Auftraggeberkonto;Konto` [M].

### 4.10 Domestic Slovenian brokers (Ilirika, NLB, Alta Invest, InterCapital, OTP, BKS…)

- **Who reports, and by when.** ZDavP-2 Art. 339 requires legal persons that are Slovenian residents, or non-residents **with a branch in Slovenia**, who carried out transfers of securities or fund units to deliver acquisition and disposal data to FURS **by 31 January** for the previous year [H].
  - InterCapital operates through "INTERKAPITAL vrijednosni papiri, Podružnica Slovenija" (SI34396594), so it falls under this rule [M].
- **Format.** The data goes in the KP_KDVP.XSD (sets PODVP / PODD / PODINVK / PODVPGB) and KP_IFI.XSD (PODIFI) schemas, submitted asynchronously via EDP.
- **Purpose: pre-filling.** FURS's stated purpose is to reuse the reported data to **pre-fill** the taxpayer's Doh-KDVP / D-IFI [H, FURS Usmeritve 2012]. The taxpayer chooses to pre-fill "from documents received from brokerage houses or banks", then verifies, corrects and signs [M].
  - The app should therefore **not** re-generate these trades. At most it should warn about overlap with imported foreign-broker data.
- **Format changes.** The delivery regulation's Annex 1 was replaced for tax year 2025 (Ur. l. RS 107/2025) and again for tax years from 1 Jan 2026 (Ur. l. RS 1409/2026, dated 3 Sep 2026, published 9 Sep 2026) [H]. The 2026 text states that **INR providers do not report trades held within an INR**.
- **INR (ZINR).** Available since 5 Mar 2026 from NLB, BKS, Ilirika, OTP, Generali Investments and JonatanMars Invest [M]. Gains are taxed at 15% on withdrawal (0% after 15 years) and withheld by the provider; "Davčne napovedi ne oddajate sami" (you do not file a return yourself) [H, NLB].
- **Dividends.** A Slovenian company paying dividends withholds 25% as a final tax, so there is no filing. Dividends paid directly from abroad must be declared by the recipient on Doh-Div by end of February [H, FURS] (28 February, moved to the next working day when it falls on a weekend; see [02 §7](02-furs-doh-div-and-others.md#7-deadlines-and-what-changed), verified). Whether a domestic custodian withholds on *foreign* dividends is not documented in sources found [L]; check the broker's annual statement.

## 6. Synthetic sample files

The research produced a synthetic sample, with exact real headers and no personal data, for every format above: eToro (three sheets as TSV), DEGIRO EN/NL Transactions and Account CSV, XTB XLSX sheets (as TSV) and the CSV variant, Lightyear CSV, Trade Republic CSV, Saxo CSV, Bitpanda CSV, Scalable CSV and Freedom24 JSON. Excerpts appear in §4. The files themselves are not committed with this page.

## Confidence

This page was **not independently verified**. The format descriptions come from parser source code and fixtures (masbug/etoro-edavki, GhostfolioSidekick, DeclaRenta, Export-To-Ghostfolio, BittyTax and others), broker help centers, legislation and forum activity. Body statements tagged [M] or [L] carry the same caveat as the claims below. The popularity ranking in §2 is a proxy, not a statistic.

The researcher rated these critical claims below high confidence:

| Confidence | Claim | Source |
|---|---|---|
| medium | An eToro closed position goes to D-IFI rather than Doh-KDVP if its Type is CFD (or OPT/FUT/FOP/Crypto Margin), or Leverage > 1, or it is a Short position; real assets are only long, unleveraged Stocks/ETF. | [masbug/etoro-edavki](https://github.com/masbug/etoro-edavki/blob/5f607d9e99/etoro_edavki.py) |
| medium | In eToro statements, Amount/Profit/fee columns are in USD while Open Rate/Close Rate are in the instrument's currency; `FX rate at open/close (USD)` converts the instrument currency to USD (`-` or 1 for USD instruments). For leveraged CFDs, Amount is the margin and notional = Amount × Leverage. | [masbug/etoro-edavki](https://github.com/masbug/etoro-edavki/blob/5f607d9e99/etoro_edavki.py) |
| superseded by §4.2 (2026-10-10) | Trade Republic's native CSV export (April 2026) has 23 quoted columns (datetime … mcc_code); `symbol` holds the ISIN, `datetime` is UTC and `date` is the local (Berlin) date. §4.2 now has two revisions, quoted or not, and `date` not always the Berlin date of `datetime`. | [GhostfolioSidekick TradeRepublicCsvRecord.cs](https://github.com/VibeNL/GhostfolioSidekick/blob/b0e397559035069670983551ed907216834e6d70/Parsers/TradeRepublic/TradeRepublicCsvRecord.cs) |
| medium | Trade Republic CSV `type` values include BUY, SELL, SAVINGS_PLAN_EXECUTED, DIVIDEND, INTEREST_PAYMENT, MIGRATION, REDEMPTION, FINAL_MATURITY; MIGRATION appears as a −n/+n pair of the same ISIN and is not a disposal. | [GhostfolioSidekick TR test files](https://github.com/VibeNL/GhostfolioSidekick/tree/b0e397559035069670983551ed907216834e6d70/Parsers.UnitTests/TestFiles/TradeRepublic/CSV) |
| medium | XTB cash-operation Type spellings vary (`DIVIDENT`/`Dividend`, `Withholding Tax`/`Withholding tax`, `Stocks/ETF purchase`/`Stock purchase`, localized variants); withholding comments look like `AAPL.US USD WHT 15%`. | [Export-To-Ghostfolio XTB sample](https://github.com/dickwolff/Export-To-Ghostfolio/blob/9e35bd602f054f563b8c728bcb36dc5eb2bbcaa5/samples/xtb-export.csv) |

**Before shipping a parser:** every fixture derived from this page must be validated against real (anonymized) exports from the broker, UI language and export version it claims to represent. The synthetic samples copy headers from public sources and contain no real account data; several formats (Saxo withholding, Bitpanda Real Securities) have not been seen in a real export at all, and Trade Republic dividends only in German residents' exports (§4.2).

## Open questions

- Trade Republic CSV dividend fields: `amount` is the gross in EUR and `original_amount` the gross in the paying currency (§4.2, settled from exports that look real). Still open: what `tax` holds for a Slovenian resident; verify against a Slovenian resident's TR dividend PDF before using for Doh-Div (#12).
- What Asset class / Transaction Type labels do Bitpanda Real Securities (real shares) use in the CSV, and is an ISIN ever exported? No primary sample found.
- Tax classification under Slovenian law of Bitpanda legacy "Stock (derivative)" contracts: D-IFI (derivative) versus Doh-KDVP. No FURS position found.
- eToro statement time zone (GMT vs local), whether eToro records splits as explicit Account Activity rows, and how partial closes create new Position IDs. Also: how a GBX or EUR instrument's rates and FX columns are written, whether `Profit(USD)` includes fees, whether Account Activity's `Asset type` uses `Type`'s words, which statements lack the EUR columns, and whether eToro ever writes dates as Excel serials. ADR 0020 refuses each until an untouched export answers it.
- Whether Slovenian domestic custodians (NLB, Ilirika, Alta, InterCapital) act as withholding agents on FOREIGN-issuer dividends credited to client accounts, or whether clients must still file Doh-Div. Not documented in the sources found.
- How eDavki merges a user-imported Doh-KDVP XML with the pre-filled data from domestic brokers (overwrite versus append), and how to avoid double-reporting when a user has both. ([01 §9](01-furs-doh-kdvp.md#9-importing-into-edavki): an imported PLVP or PLD list that already exists in the return is merged into it, PLVPGB is always added; the merge key is unknown.)
- Effective date and transitional rules of the October 2025 ZDDOIFI amendment (flat 25% on derivatives), which affects eToro/XTB CFD D-IFI computations for tax year 2026. (Effective date answered in [04 §2.4](04-si-tax-rules.md#24-contrast-derivatives-under-zddoifi-filed-on-doh-ifi-not-doh-kdvp), verified: tax years from 1 Jan 2026 under ZDDOIFI-B art. 5. Leveraged trading uses 0.25% + 0.25% normed costs, and CFD financing income is interest on Doh-Obr. Transitional rules beyond that were not covered.)
- Exact DEGIRO header strings for German, French and Italian UIs, and whether the Order ID / trailing-column misalignment is universal. DEGIRO's helpdesk blocks automated fetches (bot check).
- XTB timestamp time zone and the exact FX treatment of `Purchase value`/`Sale value` (conversion rate and 0.5% FX fee) for EUR accounts trading USD stocks.
- Saxo: how dividend withholding tax is represented (separate row versus netted) and which of the two observed Transactions export layouts is current.
- Lightyear: an official help-center description of the CSV "Transaction report" (the help center only documents the PDF statements), and the time zone of its timestamps.
- Whether Freedom24's XLSX/XML broker report formats are stable enough to support alongside JSON, and the full list of `corporate_actions` `type_id` values (split, conversion, spin-off).
