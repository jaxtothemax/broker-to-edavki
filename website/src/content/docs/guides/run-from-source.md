title: Run it from source
description:
  Try TaxReporter before its first release, on your own computer, from the command line or
  in your browser.
---

There is no release yet: the first version, v0.1, is underway (see the
[roadmap](/roadmap/)). Its source can already read your exports and write the returns, so you
can try it on your own computer. Treat what it writes as a draft to check, not a return to
file.

## What it reads today

- **Trading 212:** the CSV export of your account history.
- **Interactive Brokers (IBKR):** an Activity Flex Query in XML (see below for its sections).
- **Trade Republic:** the transaction export (CSV), with all transactions. Its dividends are
  not read yet: a file with one stops both returns and says why.
- **eToro, not yet checked against a real export with trades:** the account statement (XLSX), from the
  day you opened the account to today, exported from eToro and not opened or saved in a
  spreadsheet program. TaxReporter reads US-dollar shares and ETFs held long, closed or still
  open, and their dividends. It leaves out CFDs with a note, sets crypto aside, and counts a
  CFD's dividend adjustments with interest, which belongs on another return. A statement that
  starts later, a short or leveraged position, a position still open that paid an overnight
  fee or whose ticker the file gives two ISINs, a position closed in part, a share in another
  currency, an activity type TaxReporter does not know, or a trade too close to midnight to
  date stops both returns, and the finding says why. A position still open whose ISIN no row
  of the file gives is refused too, but it holds back only the Doh-KDVP of a year with a sale
  of any security from 30 days before its purchase on, never the Doh-Div. A statement with no
  closed positions, account activity or dividends is read with a warning: if the account ever held anything, use a statement
  exported from the day you opened it in its place. The reader was written from other tools' code and one published
  sample, and checked only against one real statement with no activity, so check its figures
  against eToro's with extra care
  ([#8](https://github.com/jaxtothemax/broker-to-edavki/issues/8)).

Export your **whole history**, from the day you opened the account: each sale is matched
against your earliest purchases of the same security first.

### Setting up the IBKR Flex Query

In the Client Portal, open **Performance & Reports → Flex Queries** and add an **Activity Flex
Query**, delivered as **XML**, with these sections:

| Section                          | What to tick                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Account Information              | Account ID and IB Entity                                       |
| Trades                           | Executions, all fields (not Orders or Symbol Summary)          |
| Corporate Actions                | All fields                                                     |
| Cash Transactions                | Dividends, Payment in Lieu of Dividends, Withholding Tax       |
| Financial Instrument Information | All fields                                                     |
| Transfers                        | All fields                                                     |

Keep the general settings at their defaults (date `yyyyMMdd`). Select every account, closed
and migrated ones included, and run the query once per calendar year since you opened the
account: IBKR returns at most 365 days at a time.

## What you need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 24 or newer.
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) 10: run `corepack enable` once, and Node provides it.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/), to fetch the source.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaxtothemax/broker-to-edavki.git
cd broker-to-edavki
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run build
```

## In your browser

```bash
pnpm --dir apps/web build
pnpm --dir apps/web preview
```

Open the address it prints (usually `http://localhost:4173`). The build carries the app's
security policy, under which the files you add are read in a background worker whose network
and storage functions are removed and which may load only the app's own files. Nothing is uploaded, and closing the tab forgets them.

`pnpm --dir apps/web dev` runs the same app for development, without that policy.

## On the command line

```bash
node apps/cli/dist/bin.js my-exports/*.csv my-exports/*.xml my-exports/*.xlsx \
  --year 2026 --tax-number 12345678 --out returns/ --payers payers.json
```

It prints what it read, the estimated tax and every finding, and writes `Doh_KDVP_2026.xml` and
`Doh_Div_2026.xml` into `returns/` when nothing blocks them; a return with nothing on it is not
written. The exit code is 0 when nothing blocks, 1 when something does, and 2 for a mistake in
the command. Add `--json` for a report other tools can read.

The JSON report says what became of each return, under `returns`: `written`; `withheld`, when
the return is needed but not written (a finding blocks it, a file was refused, or the write
failed); or `nothingToFile`. While any file is refused, both returns are `withheld`, because a
file that was not read may hold the year's sales or payments; `refused` says which. The
`estimates` are given in every case, but for a withheld return the figure may change once what
stops it is fixed. The plain text says the same on each return's line.

The JSON report also lists the shares you still hold, under `holdings`, in two views:

- **`accounts`**: each account's own position per security, which you can compare with what
  the broker shows, and the day it is as of: the last day that account's files cover. An
  account is named by its broker and a number (`ibkr-1`), never by its account number.
- **`securities`**: the lots still open across all your accounts, matched first in, first out.
  These are the lots your next sale will be taxed against. Each lot shows its purchase date,
  its cost in euro at the Banka Slovenije rate of that day, and `nextBucket`: the lower tax
  rate it moves to next and the date it applies `from`, or `null` once a lot is exempt. That
  date is the day after the anniversary, because FURS has not said whether the anniversary
  itself counts. A security's `asOf` is the earliest last day among the accounts that hold
  it, since after that day one of them may have traded it in a file you did not add.

Market prices are never fetched, so holdings show what you paid, not what the shares are
worth. If earlier exports are missing, holdings come out too low. An account's day can be
past the end of the exchange rates the app ships with only as far as its own trades reach,
so a cash row dated years ahead does not make every lot look old. Three flags say where a
figure may be wrong:

- `transferred`: the account's files move shares in or out, which are not read yet.
- `refusedRows`: a row of the account's files was refused, so its position may be missing it.
- `incomplete`: your files sell more of the security than they buy.

If the holdings cannot be worked out, `holdings` is `null` and the returns are written as
usual.

Brokers do not export a dividend payer's address, which Doh-Div needs, so give it in a small
JSON file, one entry per security (by ISIN):

```json
{
  "US1912161007": {
    "name": "The Coca-Cola Company",
    "address": "One Coca-Cola Plaza, Atlanta, GA 30313, United States",
    "country": "US"
  }
}
```

A Slovenian payer also takes `"taxNumber"`, and a foreign one may take its
`"identificationNumber"`.

## Before you import anything

Compare every figure with your broker's own statements, and read every finding. TaxReporter
prepares a return for you to check; it does not file it, and it is not tax advice. If a number
looks wrong, please [open an issue](https://github.com/jaxtothemax/broker-to-edavki/issues), without
attaching your files.
