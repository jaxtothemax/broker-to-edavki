/**
 * Trading 212 Invest and ISA history exports (CSV), every header revision
 * the research found (docs/research/06-brokers-ibkr-t212-revolut.md §4).
 *
 * What it reads, and why:
 *
 * - **Columns by name**, never position: Trading 212 has moved them around
 *   at least twice. A column it does not know blocks the import if any row
 *   fills it, since its meaning could change an amount (06 §2.3).
 * - **Dates by the one date policy.** Rows carry UTC times, which the
 *   ledger keeps; the trade or payment date is what core's `taxDate` makes
 *   of them, for now the Slovenian calendar date of the instant (06 §2.2;
 *   ADR 0011 §7). A row that cannot be dated is refused, unless its action
 *   refuses it first, for what it is (ADR 0019 §6).
 * - **Trades at the contract price**, in the instrument's currency (GBX for
 *   pence, which the rate lookup scales). Fees, T212's own exchange rate and
 *   its realized result are never used: costs are covered by the normed
 *   costs, and every conversion uses the BSI rate (06 §2.1; 04 §4.2).
 * - **Gross dividends** are shares times the price per share, which T212
 *   gives net of tax, plus the tax withheld (06 §4.3). The tax becomes its
 *   own withholding event, joined to the dividend by key.
 * - **Splits** come as a "close" row with the position before and an "open"
 *   row with the position after. Their ratio is the simplest whole-number
 *   one that turns one into the other; a pair that does not fit one blocks.
 *   The same split reported by another account is merged by the FIFO engine,
 *   which owns that rule.
 * - **Refused, not guessed:** actions whose tax treatment is not settled
 *   (payments in lieu, "tax exempted" dividends, transfers, spin-offs,
 *   stock distributions) and any action this adapter does not know.
 * - **Duplicates** across overlapping exports: T212 reuses order IDs and
 *   leaves them empty on dividends, so a row's key is built by core's key
 *   builder from its content, the time cut to the second, plus how many
 *   identical rows came before it in the same file (06 §2.5). Two identical
 *   fills stay two; the same fill in two files is one.
 * - **One account per file**, the group the user put it in: T212 exports
 *   do not name the account (ADR 0011 §4).
