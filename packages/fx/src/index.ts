/**
 * @taxreporter/fx — Banka Slovenije reference rates: the snapshot the app
 * ships (built from BSI's history files) and the lookup that picks the rate
 * for a given currency and day, with its provenance.
 *
 * Platform-neutral like @taxreporter/core (browser app and CLI): no Node.js
 * built-ins, enforced by `make build` (tsconfig.build.json). The snapshot
 * files are passed in as text; each app loads them its own way.
