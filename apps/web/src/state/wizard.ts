/**
 * The import → details → dashboard flow as a pure reducer, so every
 * navigation rule is unit-testable without a DOM. The dashboard (#47) is
 * where the flow ends: the figures, the entries and the downloads, each
 * return withheld on its own while a note stops it (ADR 0018 §6), so no
 * step after it needs a gate.
 *
 * Two modes: "demo" walks the flow on the bundled demo data, "own" reads the
 * user's own files in the engine worker (ADR 0013). The reducer holds what
 * the engine answered, never the files themselves: their bytes live with the
 * app, outside any state that could be logged or kept. Each answer carries
 * the number of the request it answers, and an answer to any but the latest
 * request is dropped, so a slow read can never overwrite a newer one.
