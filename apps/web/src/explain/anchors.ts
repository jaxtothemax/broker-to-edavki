/**
 * Explainer anchors: the names by which an explanation points at an element on
 * a screen (ADR 0016). A screen spreads `explain(name, key)` onto the element,
 * and the guided tour finds it by that name, never by a class or an id, so
 * restyling a screen cannot silently move what an explanation points at. The
 * names outlive the tour: they are meant to carry "why" text on the review of
 * the user's own files too.
 *
 * Each name says how its element is measured: "box" for a card, chip, button
 * or field (its border box), "text" for a table cell or a span of text (the
 * extent of its text, so a line ends at the words and not at a wide cell's
 * padding).
